### Yeti Update

For this week on Open Hours, [Reid](https://twitter.com/reid) will share his recent progress on [Yeti](http://yeti.cx), our easy YUI Test runner, and share our plans for the next few releases.

Recent updates to Yeti include: [improved display of test results](http://yeti.cx/blog/2012/08/yeti-0-2-8-released/), and improved handling of connection problems. These changes make Yeti easier to use. Our next target is to run Yeti for YUI's automated builds. To improve on our existing system, we plan to complete each test batch as fast as possible by taking advantage of many copies of the same browser.

If you're interested in web app testing or just want to know more, please join us!

### Time & Details

We'll be online on **Thursday from 10am to 11am PDT**.
