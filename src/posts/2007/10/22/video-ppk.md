Peter-Paul Koch (PPK) is one of the best-known figures in the world of frontend engineering because over the years he has tirelessly tilted against the windmills of browser quirks. [His quirksmode blog](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/) has the canonical articles on many subjects; for example, if you want to find out how events differ across browsers, [PPK's event compatibility tables are an essential reference](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_compinfo.html). Having the patience to do the research and the generosity to share his findings have been the hallmarks of PPK's work as a blogger-engineer.

In what looks to be an even more significant second act, PPK has embarked recently on a project to create a professional organization for frontend engineers in his native Holland. The organization is called "Fronteers" (**front**end engin**eers**); he has [documented the project on his blog](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2007/09/founding_a_fron.html) and has more recently been out at conferences speaking to his fellow frontend engineers about the concept.

At [Nate](http://nate.koechley.com/)'s invitation, PPK stopped by Yahoo! last week to tell us about Fronteers and its intended role in professionalizing the discipline in Holland. PPK was kind enough to allow us to record the event and share it on [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/). If you have comments or questions about the Fronteers concept, I'm sure he'd love to hear from you in the comments here or [on his own blog](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2007/09/founding_a_fron.html).
