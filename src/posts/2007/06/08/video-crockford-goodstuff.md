Douglas Crockford provided a keynote talk for the [2007 Konfabulator Developer Day](http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=21) yesterday. His talk was entitled "Javascript: The Good Parts" — a topic of interest to Konfabulator hackers, much of whose work is done in JavaScript.

This talk, now one of five talks from Douglas up on the [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/), is the most reflective one we've covered. Douglas takes you on a journey through the lens of his own personal experience with JavaScript — a journey from deep skepticism about a flawed, half-baked scripting language in the earliest days to a growing affection for what is now a still-flawed but surprisingly beautiful and powerful language that has "radically changed my way of thinking about programming languages."

> Once you learn to think in JavaScript, I found it completely changed the way I program. Not only that, it made be a better Java programmer. So when I go back and I'm working in the classical languages, I find that I'm writing lighter in that environment, too, even though it's an environment that encourages...profoundly heavy programming. **(28:10)**

At the end of the day, Douglas advises that we approach JavaScript the way Michaelangelo approached an unsculpted block of marble — that is, with an eye toward its intrinsic beauty. Through the use of tools like [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) (which is also, apropos of this event, [a Yahoo! Widget written in JavaScript and running on the Konfabulator platform](http://www.widgetgallery.com/view.php?widget=37484)), and through studying the unique properties of JavaScript's lambda nature, he argues that we can find in JavaScript a language for writing great software _and_ a language that will help us become better writers of software. Many thanks to Douglas and the Konfabulator team for letting us record and publish this on YUI Theater.
