In an effort to increase the transparency and frequency of our release cycles, the YUI team has been trying out some new processes. Over the coming months, we'll be posting more granular information about our development sprints, and we'll also be providing regular preview releases to the community for testing. Today's release is the first in a series of previews along the way to the 3.4.0 GA release. Without further ado, YUI 3.4.0 PR1 is now available via CDN: [http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.4.0pr1/build/yui/yui-min.js](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.4.0pr1/build/yui/yui-min.js).

We would appreciate any early testing by our community. The list of issues addressed in this release is available [here](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/73), and you can file any new bugs and regressions you find [here](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/newticket?version=3.4.0%20PR1) (you must be logged in to file a ticket).
