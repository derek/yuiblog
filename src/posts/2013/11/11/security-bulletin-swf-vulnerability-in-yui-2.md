### Overview

An external source has notified us of a previously unknown security vulnerability in YUI 2 involving hosted `uploader.swf` files. This vulnerability impacts YUI 2 versions **2.5.0** through **2.9.0** and allows arbitrary JavaScript to be run by passing in a query string parameter such as this one:

uploader.swf?allowedDomain=\\%22}%29%29%29}catch%28e%29{alert%28document.domain%29;}//

This problem is not reproducible in YUI 3.

### Resolution

If you are using or even merely hosting any YUI 2 `.swf` file, please take steps to remove these files immediately from your hosts.

YUI 2 is an [end-of-lifed project](/yuiblog/blog/2011/04/13/announcing-yui-2-9-0/) and is no longer supported. All YUI 2 `.swf` files have been removed from the Yahoo CDN. If your site was taking advantage of the presence of these files on the Yahoo CDN they will no longer be available.

### Additional Information

We recommend projects remove all Flash-based features unless they are prepared to devote proper resources and attention to addressing security issues.

Note that all Flash files have been already [deprecated and removed from YUI 3](/yuiblog/blog/2013/10/07/yui-3-13-0-released/#removalsanddeprecations). If you must use these features, you will need to compile and host your own `.swf` files using source from the [yui3-swfs repo](https://github.com/yui/yui3-swfs).

These details have been captured as well in a [YUI Security Bulletin](http://yuilibrary.com/support/20131111-vulnerability/) for future reference.
