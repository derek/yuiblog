YUI uses [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to host all of its project code, and all of its open-sourced code is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/yui/). Git is an exciting departure from traditional version control systems like CVS and SVN because the notion of distribution is embedded in its DNA. YUI engineering manager Jenny Donnelly ([@jennyd](http://twitter.com/jennyd)) gives an introduction to Git and how to use it in the real world, including branching and committing, a typical git workflow, merge vs rebase, and tips and tricks that will make your life easier.
