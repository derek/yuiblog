**Problem Summary**

A product or website needs to present ratings and reviews with a variety of informational elements.

[![Elements of a review](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/images/sub_rnrarc.gif)](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_architectureofreview.php)

Unlike the other patterns released today, this pattern is a pure information architecture pattern. It describes what informational elements belong in a user review.

The pattern can be found at: [Architecture of a Review](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_architectureofreview.php).
