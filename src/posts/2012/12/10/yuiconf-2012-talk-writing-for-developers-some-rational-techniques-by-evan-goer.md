Up next in our YUIConf 2012 [video series](/yuiblog/blog/2012/12/07/yuiconf-2012-talk-caridy-patino-on-mojito-for-yui-developers/) is a talk from [Evan Goer](http://lanyrd.com/profile/evangoer/). In addition to speaking and working at Yahoo!, Evan has written the excellent [YUI 3 Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/YUI-3-Cookbook-Cookbooks-OReilly/dp/1449304192/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354916631&sr=8-1). This talk was one of the most highly rated of the conference. Be sure to keep up on our video releases on [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/yuilibrary).

In this talk presented at YUIConf 2012, Yahoo! frontend engineer and YUI 3 Cookbook author Evan Goer discusses the principles behind clear and logical writing, and methods for organizing prose at the micro level. Evan also talks about ways of avoiding bad advice and focusing on what truly matters in writing. According to him, "this is the stuff your college writing instructors should have taught you, but probably didn't."
