### Checking in with Dav

We last chatted with [Dav Glass](http://twitter.com/davglass) in [May](/yuiblog/blog/2012/05/21/yui-open-hours-thurs-may-24th/), and as you can imagine, he hasn't been idle since then. So it's time for us to peek over his shoulder once again!

We'll walk through [Shifter](/yuiblog/blog/2012/08/27/shifter-fast-yui-module-building/), his new Node.js-based YUI module build tool, and answer questions about moving from ant to node. And of course, he'll talk about the other exciting stuff he's been up to (no spoilers here, you'll have to join us to find out).

If you have questions for Dav, you now know where to be this Thursday!

### Recording

The recording is [available in the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4ozoej5y08&hd=1).
