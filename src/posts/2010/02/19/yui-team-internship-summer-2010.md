The YUI team has an opened a position for a summer intern ([full details on the Yahoo! internship program are available here](http://careers.yahoo.com/universityinterns.php)). If you're a college student working toward a CS degree and the idea of spending the summer working on JavaScript/CSS projects alongside people like [Douglas Crockford](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-yuiconf2009-state "Video: Douglas Crockford — The State and Future of JavaScript (YUI Theater)") and on the team that created [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ "YUI Library") ([Matt Sweeney](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=sweeney-yuiconf2009-performance "Video: Matt Sweeney — YUI 3 Performance (YUI Theater)"), [Adam Moore](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/yui/ "YUI 3: YUI Global Object"), [Dav Glass](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=glass-yuiconf2009-contributing "Video: Dav Glass — Contributing to YUI (YUI Theater)"), [Jenny Donnelly](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/4693580/12542476 "Jenny Donnelly: "), [Luke Smith](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=smith-yuiconf2009-events "Video: Luke Smith — Events Evolved (YUI Theater)"), Tripp Bridges, [Allen Rabinovich](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=rabinovich-yuiconf2009-charts "Video: Allen Rabinovich — YUI 3 Infographics (YUI Theater)"), [Alaric Cole](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Learning-Flex-3/Alaric-Cole/e/9780596517328/ "Learning Flex 3, Adobe Developer Library Series, Alaric Cole, Book - Barnes & Noble"), [Satyen Desai](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets "Video: Satyen Desai — A Widget Walkthrough (YUI Theater)") and others) sounds like fun, this may be the opportunity for you.

The YUI team is responsible for development and maintenance of the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/index.html "YUI Library"), a collection of JavaScript and CSS components that help frontend engineers create Yahoo-scale web applications quickly. We also build out other parts of the professional frontend engineer's toolchain — tools like [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ "YUI Compressor"), [YUI Doc](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/ "YUI Doc"), [YUI Test](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/ "YUI 2: YUI Test"), and [YUI PHP Loader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/phploader/ "YUI PHP Loader Utility [beta]").

We're looking for an intern who has completed at least one year of formal coursework toward a CS degree and who has a track record of creating innovative browser-based applications. Both undergrads and graduate students are welcome to apply. This may be a good fit for you if:

-   you're familiar with best practices in frontend engineering (e.g., [this video](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/4671445/12486762 "Nate Koechley: ") should make good sense to you);
-   you love JavaScript (ie, [downloading and watching these videos sounds like a good time](/yuiblog/crockford/ "Crockford on JavaScript: A Public Lecture Series at Yahoo!"));
-   you learn fast;
-   you're not afraid of big challenges;
-   you're a full-time student at an accredited college or university.

If this sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you. Email a cover letter, resume, and link to your portfolio to yui-jobs@yahoo-inc.com. Be sure to mention your dates of summer availability.
