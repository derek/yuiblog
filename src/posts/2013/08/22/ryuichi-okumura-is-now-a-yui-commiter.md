We are happy to announce a new [Committer](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/live-docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md#committers) to the YUI project, Ryuichi Okumura ([@okuryu](https://github.com/okuryu)).

Ryuichi has been a developer on the Yahoo! Japan platform group for over 6 years, and hopes to work on both the [Intl](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/Intl.html) and [Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/calendar/) components.

Welcome Ryuichi!
