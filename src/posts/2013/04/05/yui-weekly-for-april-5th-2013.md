HQ in Sunnyvale, CA next Thursday evening where we'll be hosting an event featuring short presentations, and conversations about the latest development going on in the world of YUI. Doors open at 5pm, talks begin at 6. Head over to [eventbrite.com](http://yuiafterhours.eventbrite.com/#) for registration and additional details.
    
-   In this week's release news, finishing touches are being put on the first 3.10 preview release. If you are curious what to expect, check out the [dev-3.x compare view](https://github.com/yui/yui3/compare/v3.9.1...dev-3.x). Most notably at this point will be performance improvements in Base ([PR #574](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/574)), and you can get a glimpse of those effects on downstream components on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/derek/5321971). YUI 3.10 is [currently scheduled](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#wiki-next-release) for release on April 16th.
