Source for the [YUI 2.x codeline](http://github.com/yui/yui2/tree/master) and the [YUI 3.x codeline](http://github.com/yui/yui3/tree/master) have joined [YUI Doc](http://github.com/yui/yuidoc/tree/master) on GitHub. Major congratulations are due to Dav Glass, who has led this process for us.

YUI has been accepting [external contributions](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/community/contribute.html) since last summer, but the move to GitHub represents a huge step forward in the process. You can now work with the latest source in both of our major codelines. And if you want to contribute code to the project, we think you'll find that both Git and GitHub make the process much easier.

There's a lot of work ahead of us on this:

1.  **Migrating our bug reporting and feature request trackers from SourceForge to [YUILibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com):** The cutover will come soon, and we'll announce that in our forums while redirecting links to the new system.
2.  **Documenting YUI build tools and prepping them for GitHub hosting:** Once the build infrastructure is on GitHub, you'll be able to build components from YUI 2.x and 3.x source to verify the integrity of your changes in terms of linting, documentation, and tests.
3.  **Moving all documentation and examples into the main repositories:** We're currently updating our example build and site build systems. Once these changes are in place, the source for user's guides and examples will join the source code in our main repositories and those resources, too, will be easy for you to work with and enhance. Today, only print documentation (in the form of cheat sheets) is included in the YUI 2.x and 3.x repositories.

We hope you enjoy exploring the YUI source code on GitHub, and we're looking forward to all that lies ahead for 2009.
