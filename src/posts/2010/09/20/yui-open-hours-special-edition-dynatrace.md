This Wednesday, on the heels of the last Open Hours, we were able to schedule a visit from [Alois Reitbauer](http://twitter.com/AloisReitbauer) from [DynaTrace Software]( http://www.dynatrace.com/). He'll be stopping onto the Yahoo! campus to give a demo of the amazing [DynaTrace Ajax edition](http://ajax.dynatrace.com/pages/), and we're opening up the presentation to you.

If you're not yet familiar with DynaTrace, it is one of the best, if not _the_ best, tools available for diagnosing just what it is that IE is doing with your code. The degree of depth and abundance of information that DynaTrace makes available to you would be amazing for any browser, but that we're talking about IE here is another level of amazing altogether.

Alois will be giving a guided tour, and talk about

-   how to do JavaScript and rendering analysis for performance
-   how to set up automated performance testing and integrate with Selenium
-   what's on the horizon for upcoming versions

We'll be starting at **10:30am Pacific Time**, a little later than, but hopefully still early enough for some of the Open Hours regulars across the pond. Otherwise, the connection info is the same:

1.  Dial in to: 1-888-371-8922 (Skype is great for non-US callers)
2.  Enter the access code 47188953#
3.  Join the [Adobe Connect session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (You will be prompted to install the plugin if you don't already have it)

We'll also be recording the session for YUI Theater, in case you can't call in for the live feed.

See you there!

#### Update

I forgot to mention that this will be happening tomorrow morning, Wednesday. Thanks coachz!
