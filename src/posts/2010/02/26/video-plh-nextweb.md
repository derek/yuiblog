[![Philippe Le Hégaret speaking at Yahoo! on January 20, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/plh-nextweb-20100122-112741.png)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=plh-nextweb)

Philippe Le Hégaret, who heads the W3C Interaction Domain, stopped by Yahoo! recently to give a talk about HTML5. While the HTML5 specification itself does actually not contain many new features, the new Web platform, often labeled as HTML5, does come with many new features. These range from HTML video to SVG to CSS animations or Web sockets. Philippe's talk gives an overview of what's ahead of us, using concrete demonstrations in latest generation Web browsers. Our thanks to Philippe for the visit and for permission to share the video on YUI Theater.
