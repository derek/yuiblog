### 3.5.0pr2 is available

We deployed [the second 3.5.0 preview release](/yuiblog/blog/2012/01/30/yui-3-5-0-pr2/) right on time, celebrated for a couple minutes, then went back to work on PR3, which will be the gating preview before 3.5.0 GA in mid-March.

But we'll stop to take a breath and highlight some of the changes in PR2. You've read the short list on the release blog post, so join us for a little more detail and probably some live tinkering.

As is the case with all preview releases, we're eager to get your feedback and any bugs you find. Or if you're note yet convinced to give it a try before the GA, maybe we can convince you.

### Recording

The recording is [available in the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KjRvxcrozc).
