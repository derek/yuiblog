Happy Monday! It's time for another great [YUIConf 2013](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/2013/) presentation video. As you know, we are posting a new one every few days in the order that you might have seen them during the conference. Today we have a great presentation from [Tilo Mitra](https://twitter.com/tilomitra) on "[The State of Gestures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vZiKThHv4Q)". If you are developing for mobile, you will definitely enjoy the insights presented here.
