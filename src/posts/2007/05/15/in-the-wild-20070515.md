On his Muffin Research Labs site [Stuart Colville shows how to re-write HTTP request so you can quickly toggle between localhost and online resources](http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2007/04/26/online-and-offline-development-with-the-yui-and-charles/). He uses the "fantastically useful cross-platform http debugging proxy" [Charles](http://www.xk72.com/charles/) to do the magic: "Through this method we can use some simple regex to re-write a request \[pointing to\] [yui.yahooapis.com](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/) to \[instead\] point at YUI files in your localhost development environment. ... Now when you hop on the train or flight you can simply turn on the charles and your yui dependent js will still work as expected."

Dave Dash on his [Spindrop](http://spindrop.us/2007/05/08/textmate-snippets-for-yui-em-calculations/) blog shares [a TextMate snippet for YUI `em` calculations](http://spindrop.us/2007/05/08/textmate-snippets-for-yui-em-calculations/). Because of the way [YUI Fonts](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts) preserves font zoomability for IE users, the size of an em in IE is slightly different than in other [A-Grade browsers](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/). The [conversion math for EMs in YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/#custom_page_width) is part of [YUI Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids) documentation, but he's right that tools to do the math for us are nice. His snippet keeps Grids' em units but gives control to "people like us who want to be super precise down to the pixel."

The [Web 3.0, 6 Bladed Razors, 7 Minute Abs](http://www.zachleat.com/web/) blog has been the destination for a string of great posts from Zach Leatherman. Most recently he's penned "[YUI DataTable and You: Making the Marriage Work](http://www.zachleat.com/web/2007/04/30/yui-datatable-and-you-making-the-marriage-work/)" as well as "[Wash your mouth out with SOAP and the YUI Connection Manager](http://www.zachleat.com/web/2007/05/09/wash-your-mouth-out-with-soap-and-the-yui-connection-manager/)." Thanks, Zach, for contributing this good stuff (and bonus points for funny titles and writing.) You've been sharing your insights and thoughts about YUI for a while now, and I really appreciate it and am listening.

The [Cheerful Curmudgeon](http://cheerfulcurmudgeon.com/) noticed the [nice things Dr. Dobb's Journal had to say about YUI](http://www.ddj.com/dept/webservices/199203087;jsessionid=A25AZLZ2ZK0RIQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?_requestid=323348) last week and chimed in with [his observations on YUI and the process of choosing a library](http://cheerfulcurmudgeon.com/2007/05/03/the-value-of-documentation-on-quick-decisions/):

> The key difference between Turner and Wang's evaluation technique and my own is simple: I skipped the technical evaluation. The existence of the Yahoo! web site (and several other YUI-based sites) was sufficient for me. I felt no need to spend any time actually writing code to "see if it worked." I looked only for the differentiators between the toolkits and the YUI documentation immediately leaped to the fore.

Lots of people are finding and loving Douglas Crockford's JavaScript video series from the [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater). Digg's founder Kevin Rose [wrote (receiving 1584 diggs)](http://digg.com/programming/The_Javascript_Programming_Language) that "\[[The JavaScript Programming Language](/yuiblog/blog/2007/01/24/video-crockford-tjpl/) is an\] excellent presentation and great insight on the history and basics. Douglas rocks, yahoo is real lucky to have him!".

The same [Crockford videos](/yuiblog/blog/2007/01/24/video-crockford-tjpl/) gave [Philip Hofstetter "Newfound respect for JavaScript."](http://www.gnegg.ch/archives/360-Newfound-respect-for-JavaScript.html) As he wrote after watching them, "\[He\] really managed to open my eyes... The day when I have seen those videos, I understood that I had the completely wrong ideas about JavaScript... If you are interested to learn a completely new, powerful side of JavaScript, I highly recommend you watch these movies."

And finally, though it's not big news that countless projects at Yahoo! use YUI, it's been awhile since we've [explored YUI use at Yahoo!](/yuiblog/blog/2006/07/18/ten_things/) in any depth. But we were thrilled to see that YUI had been a part of the new [Yahoo! Green](http://green.yahoo.com/) site. In addition to Yahoo! as a company [pledging to go carbon neutral](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070417130916AALJPjh), Yahoos put together this new site to aggregate environmental news, create calls to action, and track progress. As part of the launch, Yahoo! co-founder [David Filo announced that Yahoo! is going to donate a fleet of hybrid taxis](http://yodel.yahoo.com/2007/05/14/whos-the-greenest-of-them-all/) to the greenest city in the country. Green is the new purple! Good stuff - corporations can't always enact the best values of their employees, and on a personal level it's gratifying that Yahoo! continues to do so with respect to environmental issues.
