**NOTE:** New conference dates have been set! **Nov 14–15** (Wed. and Thurs.) at the **[Santa Clara Marriott](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sjcga-santa-clara-marriott/).**

If you are planning to come to YUIConf, please read this carefully! Due to the high level of potential conflicts with the originally listed dates for the YUIConf, we are considering moving the conference to a later date. Please **hold off** on making reservations and other plans until we can get you more details. We will post an update as soon as we can confirm the dates.
