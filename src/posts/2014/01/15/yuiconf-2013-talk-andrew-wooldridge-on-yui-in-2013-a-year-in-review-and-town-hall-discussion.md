It's Friday, and that signals the release of another YUIConf 2013 video. This one includes a brief presentation by me, [Andrew Wooldridge](https://twitter.com/triptych), and then a town hall discussion with the YUI community at the conference. The talk is entitled "[YUI in 2013: A Year in Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY3K3tTyXn8)". If you'd like to jump right to the discussion portion go to [27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY3K3tTyXn8#t=27m20s).

As usual, you can check out the [previous video](/yuiblog/blog/2014/01/15/yuiconf-2013-talk-staying-dry-with-yui/), as well as find [all of the currently available videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKP9DUCzZorde6sLWHJ3GNd-6VrGrbqm) on our YouTube playlist.
