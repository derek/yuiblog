_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   This week marks the conclusion of [Sprint 10](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#sprint-10-next-release)'s primary development cycle. At the beginning of next week, a release branch will be cut from dev-3.x and **YUI 3.13.0-rc-1** will be released shortly thereafter. After a week of testing and showstopper bug fixing, the release for **YUI 3.13.0** will be targeted for Tuesday, October 8th.
