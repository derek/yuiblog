YUI 3.5.0 Preview Release 1 has been deployed for testing and feedback from the developer community. You can find it on the Yahoo! CDN at [yui.yahooapis.com/3.5.0pr1/build/yui/yui-min.js](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.5.0pr1/build/yui/yui-min.js), or [download a zip file](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.5.0pr1.zip) if you plan to host it yourself.

The [rollup of changes introduced in PR1](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/YUI-3.5.0PR1-History-Rollup) is available on our GitHub Wiki. In addition, you can review [the list of tickets that were resolved in this release](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/104).

Work-in-progress [user guides](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/guides/) and [API docs](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/) for 3.5.0 can be found on our staging site, but beware that these docs may be incomplete or even broken, since this is where we test new stuff. Official docs for the latest stable release can always be found on our production site, [yuilibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com/).

More changes will be introduced in the upcoming preview releases of YUI 3.5.0; some of them are currently in developers' own branches and are available for initial review via the following pull requests:

If all goes according to plan, we hope to release YUI 3.5.0 PR2 on January 30th, 2012. Happy holidays!
