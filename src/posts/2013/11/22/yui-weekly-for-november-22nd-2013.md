Howdy! Well, this week zoomed by faster than JavaScript running on V8, and it's YUI Weekly time again. This will be the last YUI Weekly before Thanksgiving, and we have quite a bit to share, so let's get started.

## Release News

We were busy testing YUI across a myriad of browsers in order to release YUI 3.14.0 on **November 25th**. Everything looks good, and you can grab YUI 3.14.0 RC-1 today. It's available from [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/yui), as a [zip](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.14.0-rc-1.zip), or [directly off the CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.14.0-rc-1/build/yui/yui-min.js). I'm sure you guys are eager to find out what changed in this version. Andrew will have the full details in our release blog post. You can get a preview by checking out the [Change History Rollup](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/YUI-3.14.0-Change-History-Rollup).

We recommend all developers try out the release candidate. If you encounter any problems, you can [file an issue](https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/new), and we can look into it before releasing the GA.

## Open Roundtable

This week's [Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TRXJAa_eP0) featured discussions on the upcoming YUI release, the status of YUIConf videos, the delay in Gallery deployments, WinJS, and Bayjax. You can [catch the entire video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TRXJAa_eP0). It's your weekly dose of YUI in 30 minutes!

## New This Week

-   There was a [BayJax meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/events/150785372/) this week that focused on JavaScript testing. Our CI expert, [Reid](http://twitter.com/reid) was there to talk about how we test YUI. You can [check out his awesome slides](http://reid.in/baytest) here.
    
-   I'm a big fan of Reid's web-based slides, but did you know that they are built using YUI? It's a project called [Upstage](https://github.com/reid/upstage) and you can check it out on GitHub.
    
-   [Caridy](https://twitter.com/caridy) [added the YUI Transpiler](https://github.com/square/es6-module-transpiler/pull/78) into Square's `es6-module-transpiler`, which is a step towards being able to transpile ES6 modules into YUI modules.
    

## The World of JavaScript

-   I recently found out that iOS 7 has a native JavaScript bridge that allows bi-directional communication between JavaScript and Obj-C. [This article](http://strongloop.com/strongblog/apples-ios7-native-javascript-bridge/) talks a bit more about that.
-   There was a status report published by Dave Herman on the [State of ES6 Modules](https://speakerdeck.com/dherman/status-report-es6-modules).
-   John Resig has created a [web application](http://ejohn.org/blog/node-js-stream-playground/) that allows you to play streams in NodeJS.
-   [JSConf Asia](http://2013.jsconf.asia/) is coming up! If you're attending, I'm jealous.

## Happy Thanksgiving

Well, that's all for this week! If you noticed, we changed up the format of these YUI Weekly posts a bit this week. Let us know if you prefer this format or the older format in the comments. Finally, on behalf of the whole team, I wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving!
