In [Luke](http://lucassmith.name)'s ([@ls\_n](http://twitter.com/ls_n)'s)second session at [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) ([the first, "Events Evolved," is also available on video](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=smith-yuiconf2009-events)), he addressed common challenges in debugging JavaScript — and some of the tools and techniques unique to doing so in [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/)\-based applications.
