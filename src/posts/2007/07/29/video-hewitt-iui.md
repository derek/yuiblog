[![Facebook's Joe Hewitt talks about the iUI library at Yahoo!.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/hewitt-iui.jpg)]( http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=853528)

[Joe Hewitt](http://joehewitt.com/), co-founder of the Firefox project and author of the popular [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) extension to Firefox, stopped by Yahoo! last week to talk about his latest creation: the [iUI JavaScript/CSS library](http://joehewitt.com/iui/) that allows developers to build web applications that emulate the visual language native iPhone applications.

In this 15-minute presentation, Joe provides an overview of how iUI works and how you can use it to jumpstart any iPhone-specific interfaces you're considering for your web apps. He also provides an outstanding overview of just what you can expect from the current iPhone web browser in terms of standards support; if you're curious about what works and what doesn't with iPhone's Safari implementation, this is a good place to start.

This presentation is [available in Flash format on Yahoo! Video]( http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=853528) and as [an MPEG-4, iPod-compatible (and iPhone-compatible!) download](http://us.dl1.yimg.com/download.yahoo.com/dl/ydn/yui/theater/hewitt-iui.m4v) (change the extension from `.m4v` to `.mp4` if your video software doesn't recognize the extension).
