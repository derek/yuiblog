![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/eduardo-lundgren.jpg)Eduardo Lundgren of Liferay will be presenting a YUI talk at [Pernambuco.JS](http://pernambucojs.com/) in Brazil April 21. This will be the first edition of the tech conference dedicated to Javascript developers of Brazil's Pernambuco state.

Eduardo, a Senior Software Engineer at Liferay, Inc., is one of the creators of the [AlloyUI](http://alloy.liferay.com/) project built on top of the YUI Library. Mainly focused on Java and JavaScript development, he has a wealth of experience in building enterprise web applications across multiple languages and platforms and is always seeking to participate in innovative open source Web projects.

Eduardo's talk, _Building Applications with YUI3 and Alloy_, will introduce the YUI 3 framework, especially APIs such as Widget, discuss YUI's approach to supporting the new set of web-enabled devices on the market today, and discuss how to think of these devices in terms of features and constraints as opposed to an isolated problem space.

Tickets are available at [http://pernambucojs.com/](http://pernambucojs.com/).
