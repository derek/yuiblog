Testing your code is one of the best things you can do for the quality of your app. For a project as large as YUI this can present a number of challenges. [Reid Burke](https://twitter.com/reid) in his YUIConf presentation "[Testing YUI Everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AABmn_h4HAM)" talks about the issues he faces daily in keeping our CI system up and healthy. You'll definitely find some great insights into how we test our code and get a glimpse of the work he's been doing. You can find the previous YUIConf talk [here](/yuiblog/blog/2014/02/28/yuiconf-2013-evan-goer-on-thinking-of-documentation-as-code/), and watch all of them [via YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKP9DUCzZorde6sLWHJ3GNd-6VrGrbqm).
