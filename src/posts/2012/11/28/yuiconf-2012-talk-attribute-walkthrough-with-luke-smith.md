In this talk from YUIConf 2012, the SmugMug sorcerer and former YUI team member [Luke Smith](http://lanyrd.com/profile/ls_n/) provides a walkthrough of the fundamentals of [Y.Attribute](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/attribute/) and its various incarnations. He goes through the runtime execution of its API explaining configurations and the rationale for using them. He also explores their relationship to events and how they are merged when extending or mixing classes.
