-   **[YUI Components with DWR — DWRDataSource](http://blog.javachap.com/?p=23):** Vijay Dendukuri [writes on his JavaChap blog](http://blog.javachap.com/?p=23): "I’m working on project which uses YUI and DWR. The hardest part is intergrating these two. I googled on how people integrated YUI and DWR, found [this](http://www.jroller.com/carlossg/entry/ajax_with_yahoo_ui_components) and [this](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/27281). But these solutions will only work with earlier versions of YUI. I’m using YUI 2.7. So i ended up writing my own DWRDataSource. Might be useful for guys who want to integrate DWR and YUI 2.7."
