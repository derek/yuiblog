[![YUI 2.4.1 is now available as a download from SourceForge.](http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/ydn/yuiweb/download_1.gif)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/)In [YUI 2.4.0](/yuiblog/blog/2007/12/04/yuii-240/), we updated the way the [Event Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/) "cleans up" events in its page unload handler. Regrettably, that change resulted in some events not being properly unloaded, which in turn resulted in IE-specific memory leaks in some YUI components (including the [Menu Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/) and controls in the [Container Family](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/)). Today's release of YUI 2.4.1 rolls back that change; it introduces no further changes. All implementers on YUI 2.4.0 are encouraged to upgrade.

YUI 2.4.1 is [available for download immediately](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/).
