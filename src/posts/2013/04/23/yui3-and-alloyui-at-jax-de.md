Our friends on the AlloyUI team at [Liferay](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/alloy-ui/overview) have been hard at work on version 2.0. This new version will bring a lot of improvements that they will be sharing at [JAX](http://jax.de/) next week. [Zeno Rocha](http://jax.de/2013/speaker#8087) ([@zenorocha](https://twitter.com/zenorocha)), Front-end Engineer at Liferay and co-founder of BrazilJS Foundation ([http://braziljs.org/](http://braziljs.org/)), is presenting both the conference [keynote](http://entwickler.com/konferenzen/ext_scripts/v2/php/sessions-popup.php?module=jax2013&id=25239) and a workshop entitled ["Getting started with YUI 3 and Alloy UI"](http://entwickler.com/konferenzen/ext_scripts/v2/php/sessions-popup.php?module=jax2013&id=25240). We are excited to see what the AlloyUI team has in store for the YUI community, and we encourage you to check out the conference!
