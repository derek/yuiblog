The YUI team [released YUI 3.1.2](http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/) today. **This is an important security update for all users of YUI 3.1.x and 3.2.0pr1**. If you are hosting YUI 3.1.x or 3.2.0pr1 on your site, or if you use YUI 3.1.x/3.2.0pr1 IO's cross-domain functionality, you are affected.

XDR in YUI's IO utility implements a Flash transport as a fallback for browsers that don't support native XDR. An error in our implementation of the Flash fallback in YUI versions 3.1.x and 3.2.0pr1 allows the `io.swf` file to operate unsafely whether served from the Yahoo! CDN or from your own server. The remedy for this problem is twofold:

-   If you have deployed the full YUI 3.1.x/3.2.0pr1 build directory to your server, replace `build/io/io.swf` in the affected version with the version included in YUI 3.1.2. **Do so whether or not you are using the IO utility or its XDR feature.**
-   If you are using IO's XDR feature, upgrading to the 3.1.2 version of `io-swf` addresses the security problem. Host version 3.1.2 of `io.swf` on your own server (this file cannot operate safely from a CDN; it is not included on the CDN as of 3.1.2). If you have been drawing `io.swf` from `http://yui.yahooapis.com`, remove this domain from your `crossdomain.xml` file.

More details about this issue can be found in [the IO utility documentation](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/io/#security).
