[![Click through to visit the announcement for inputEx v. 0.1.0](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/inputx.png)](http://javascript.neyric.com/blog/2008/05/07/inputex-010-released/)

Parisian coder Eric Abouaf (aka "Neyric") [released version 0.1.0](http://javascript.neyric.com/blog/2008/05/07/inputex-010-released/) of his YUI-based forms library, [inputEx](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/).

As of this release, inputEx supports only client-side-generated views — form fields are configured in a JSON format and created for you on the fly. Eric identifies the following unique features in inputEx:

> -   **complex data structures** (list/objects/tree/list of urls/objects of objects etc…)
> -   **composition** between the fields (for “meta”-fields such as InPlaceEdit, List, Tree, Pair, …)
> -   **javascript object mapping** for greater interactivity
> -   a **common “updated” event** to handle different browsers and different field interactions

Eric has [API docs](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/doc/js_docs_out/index.html), a [Getting Started](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/doc/js_docs_out/getting_started.html) tutorial, [examples](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/doc/js_docs_out/examples.html), and more [on the website](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/). He's looking for contributors, if you're interested in extending the library; check out the website for full details on the project.
