Earlier we posted video from [Douglas Crockford's talk on JSON at the BayJax meetup on July 27](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-json). [Next up is Jonathan LeBlanc](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=leblanc-yql), a technical evangelist at the Yahoo! Developer Network who spoke about one of Yahoo!'s most intriguing developer offerings, [YQL (the Yahoo! Query Language)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/).

In this 24-minute session, [Jonathan provides an introduction to YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=leblanc-yql) and then goes on to show how it can be used in combination with the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) in the rapid creation of dynamic, data-driven interfaces where the data comes from hetereogeneous sources across the web. I suspect you'll be surprised and intrigued, to say the least, if this is your first introduction to YQL; it's the kind of service that makes you want to clear your calendar for a couple of days' worth of uninterrupted hacking.

Thanks again to [the Bayjax team](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/) and to Gonzalo Cordero for helping to bring the event to Yahoo!.
