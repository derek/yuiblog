[![ArenaNet engineer Pat Cavit speaks at YUIConf 2010 at Yahoo! HQ in Sunnyvale, CA.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf2010-cavit-20101129-143014.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-cavit)

[ArenaNet](http://www.arena.net/ "ArenaNet") engineer and YUI contributor Pat Cavit ([@tivac](http://twitter.com/#!/tivac "Pat Cavit on Twitter")) presents the second part of a two-part series on how to move from implementing simple functionality in YUI 3 to producing modular, reusable components that leverage YUI 3's component infrastructure (including widgets and plugins). ([Part 1 in the series, presented by Anthony Pipkin, is also available on YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-pipkin "Video: Anthony Pipkin — The Next Step: From Idea to Widget (Part 1) (YUI Theater)").)

On a personal note, Pat and wife Misty just welcomed new baby Fiona into the world. From everyone here at YUI central: Congratulations...we suspect she's already comfortable on the command line and thinking about reusable code.
