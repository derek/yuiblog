The YUI team has discovered a security-related defect in certain self-hosted YUI 2 `.swf` files. This defect allows JavaScript injection exploits to be created against domains that host these affected `.swf` files, _whether or not the .swf files are embedded in your application_. [Visit the security bulletin for full details about how to identify and replace the affected files.](http://yuilibrary.com/support/20121030-vulnerability/)

If your site hosts a YUI 2 distribution between version 2.4.0 and 2.9.0 that includes these files, it is affected by this vulnerability.

If your site loads YUI 2 from Yahoo’s CDN (yui.yahooapis.com) or from Google’s CDN (ajax.googleapis.com), and the files are not hosted on your own domain, you are not affected. YUI 3 is not affected by this issue.

See the [security bulletin](http://yuilibrary.com/support/20121030-vulnerability/) for information about how to determine whether your site is affected, how to remedy the problem, and how to verify the fix.

**Note:** This vulnerability is also listed under [CVE-2012-5881](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5881), [CVE-2012-5882](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5882), and [CVE-2012-5883](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5883).
