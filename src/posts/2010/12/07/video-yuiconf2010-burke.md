[![YUI engineer Reid Burke speaks at YUIConf 2010 at Yahoo! HQ in Sunnyvale, CA.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf2010-burke-20101125-091356.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-burke)

Testing cross-browser web applications has been too difficult for too long: You're either manually reloading browsers or struggling with complicated automation software. In this session from [YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/), YUI engineer Reid Burke ([@reid](http://twitter.com/reid)) talks about how [YUI's Yeti project](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yeti/ "Yeti :: YUI Library") helps to address these problems. Reid discusses when you should use automated testing for your frontend code, how Yeti works with [YUI Test](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/yuitest/ "YUI 3: YUI Test"), how to setup cross-browser testing in minutes and how the YUI team uses Yeti to ship a better product. (A useful and related session from YUIConf 2010 is [Nicholas C. Zakas's presentation on the new YUI Test](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-yuitest "Video: Nicholas C. Zakas — YUI Test (YUI Theater)").)

### Other Recent YUI Theater Videos:

-   [**Douglas Crockford:** Project Future](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-projectfuture) — Yahoo! JavaScript architect Douglas Crockford reflects on the life of Walt Disney, who dreamed of creating a 'City of the Future' in Florida as part of the project that became Disney World. (This is not a technical session, but rather one about big dreams and the life lessons we can draw from them.)
-   [**Tom Hughes-Croucher:** How to Stop Writing Spaghetti Code](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-croucher) — In this session from YUIConf 2010, Yahoo! engineer Tom Hughes-Croucher explores different coding styles for event-driven, non-blocking server-side JavaScript and which styles are most successful.
-   [**Norbert Lindenberg:** Internationalizing Applications Using YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-lindenberg) — On the web as in the real world, every language is a minority language. To reach a majority of users, your software will need to support multiple languages and be adapted to the needs and expectations of different cultures. In this session from YUIConf 2010, Yahoo! internationalization architect Norbert Lindenberg discusses how to do this building on YUI 3.
-   [**Tilo Mitra:** Handling Data in YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-mitra) — Yahoo! engineering intern Tilo Mitra introduces the YUI 3 data-lifecycle toolkit, including facilities for data sources, schemas, and the new-for-3.3.0 YUI DataTable widget.
-   [**Matt Taylor:** YUI 3 & Node.js for JavaScript View Rendering on Client or Server](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-taylor) — Most web application frameworks have some type of templating engine that accepts two things: (1) data, (2) template, and returns HTML to be assembled into an HTTPResponse. The promise of Node.js and YUI 3 running server-side is that a new era of frameworks is possible in which view rendering on the client and server is implemented with the same JavaScript-based code.
