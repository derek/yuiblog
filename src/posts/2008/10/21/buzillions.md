[![The YUI Overlay on Buzillions.com; click through to check out their redesign using YUI 2.6.0.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/buzillions-panel.png)](http://www.buzzillions.com/4294811225_4294811422_nz_vegan_product_reviews)

Jim Morris, VP for the Buzillions Platform at PowerReviews, wrote in to tell us that Buzillions launched a major redesign recently, including a comprehensive update to YUI 2.6.0. A dozen YUI components are exercised throughout the site. We first wrote about Jim's team and their work [more than two years ago](/yuiblog/blog/2006/10/13/powerreviews/) — it's great to see how their product, and its use of YUI, has evolved over time.

Here's a [Vegan Product Reviews section](http://www.buzzillions.com/4294811225_4294811422_nz_vegan_product_reviews) Jim set up for me. Note the smooth use of YUI Animation and Overlays when you hover over a product image.

Buzillions.com is a consumer reviews portal; its underlying platform is used by online vendors around the world.
