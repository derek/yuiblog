YUI architect Matt Sweeney's ([@msweeney](http://twitter.com/msweeney)) talk at [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) focused on extracting maximum performance from [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/). He drilled into the seed file options, lazy-loading strategies, and YUI 3 techniques for DOM and Event interaction that keep overhead low and performance high. He concluded with a review of his internal benchmarks for YUI 3 using the Slickspeed and Taskspeed performance suites.
