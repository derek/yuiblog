[![Lang's little gems, on PlankDesign.com](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/plank.jpg)](http://plankdesign.com/en/blog/posts/langs_little_gems)

Mitch at [PlankDesign.com](http://plankdesign.com/) [has posted a nice review](http://plankdesign.com/en/blog/posts/langs_little_gems) of one of the least-discussed aspects of YUI Core — the [YAHOO Global Object](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yahoo/)'s `YAHOO.lang` member. He covers a number of the language conveniences provided therein, including type checking, `trim`, `substitute`, `later` and `merge`.

Luke Smith from the YUI team recently [added some great examples of other features in the YAHOO object](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/yahoo/index.html), so check those out, too, if you're interested in learning more about this essential building block of YUI.

Thanks for the insights, Mitch!
