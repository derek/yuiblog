### Tag (YUI Gallery module)

For this week's Open Hours we'll be talking with Yahoo! engineer [Stephen Murphy](https://github.com/twobit) about his [Tag module](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/tag), which provides a way to hook into Node creation and insertion. It allows you to build components that behave more like standard DOM nodes.

Stephen will be showing us how the Tag module works, how you can use it in your applications, and why Tag can be useful.

If you want to learn how the Tag Gallery module and catch up on the latest YUI news, please join us!
