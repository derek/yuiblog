_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   This week saw the release of **YUI 3.13.0**. You can find all the details in the [release announcement](/yuiblog/2013/10/07/yui-3-13-0-released/). Thanks to the dozens of contributors who have submitted hundreds of commits [over the past month](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pulse/monthly). With Sprint 11 beginning next week, expect an update to the [development schedule wiki](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule) soon.
    
-   At this week’s [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable), discussion topics included an update from Anthony Pipkin ([@apipkin](https://twitter.com/apipkin)) on [Editor](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/editor) and [DataTable](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/datatable/), [YUI 3.13.0](/yuiblog/2013/10/07/yui-3-13-0-released/) higlights, and an in-depth review into [stale pull requests](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pulls?direction=asc&page=1&sort=updated&state=open). You can find a video of that Hangout [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1I_0NF4Cos).
    
-   Congratulations to JSON, which this week became a formal international data processing standard! _"JSON is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format. It was derived from the ECMAScript programming language, but is programming language independent. JSON defines a small set of structuring rules for the portable representation of structured data."_ You can find the full ECMA-404 spec [here](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm).
    
-   A little-known feature with [Y.Anim](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/anim/) is that it can actually be used for non-DOM animations. Here's [a comment](https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/1286#issuecomment-25928588) on a feature request that explains how to use that module and [Y.Easing](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/files/anim_js_anim-easing.js.html) to calculate step-values for an arbitrary animation.
    
-   ["Building Beautiful Web Apps using Pure CSS"](https://speakerdeck.com/tilomitra/building-beautiful-web-apps-using-pure-css) is a presentation by YUI team member Tilo Mitra ([@tilomitra](http://twitter.com/tilomitra)) that was given at the recent [Yahoo Hack USA](http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/62748207228/yahoo-hack-usa-its-a-wrap) event. If you haven't yet checked out [Pure](http://purecss.io/), give the slide deck for a nice intro to the CSS library.
    
-   Recent threads on the [contributor mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/yui-contrib) include continued discussion on [supporting nesting Y.Apps](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/vFZV2zUMepM) and [improving gesture events in YUI](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/hwRCA2o5Ks8). These on-going discussions so far have resulted in [Nested Y.Apps Spike](https://github.com/orionhealth/nested-y-apps-spike) and [PR #1329](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1309).
