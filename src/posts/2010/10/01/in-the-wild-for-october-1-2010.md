There has been significant buzz this week about [Dav Glass's tech talk on YUI 3 support in Node.js](/yuiblog/blog/2010/09/29/video-glass-node/) and what that enables in terms of progressive enhancement, as well as for [Matt Taylor's YUI 3 Gallery module for RaphaelJS](/yuiblog/blog/2010/09/27/gallery-raphaeljs/). Luke Smith had a nice developer tip on the blog this week [on extending YUI to "add your own awesome](/yuiblog/blog/2010/09/29/quick-tip-extend-node/)," [developer Stefan Klopp from CarRentalExpress.com shared his thoughts about using YUI 2 to power his site](/yuiblog/blog/2010/09/28/carrentalexpress/), and [Carlo Zottmann shared his gorgeous new "Dana" theme for YUI's documentation workhorse, YUI Doc](/yuiblog/blog/2010/10/01/yuidoc-dana-theme/).

Meanwhile, here are a few other recent pieces of news from the community:

-   **[Andrew Wooldridge -- "Learning YUI: Introduction"](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2010/09/30/learning-yui-introduction/):** Andrew Wooldridge ([@triptych](http://twitter.com/triptych)) is embarking on a series of YUI articles on his blog, and the introductory piece is online: "I’ve decided to write a few articles about getting starting in YUI, and various things I learn as I go along... I assume you have some sort of need for a javascript library, or perhaps you read about YUI and are basically curious about it. Let me give you a bit of a background. YUI was originally created as a common set of javascript library functions within Yahoo years ago, with the idea of allowing web developers to have a basic set of functionality to use inside Yahoo pages. This naturally grew and expanded – breaking out of just Yahoo and also moving towards and open set of components you see today. Yahoo folks curate the library but take changes and updates from anyone, and you are free to use this code any way you like... YUI may seem like this giant set of libraries, doing everything from animations to widgets, but in reality the YUI team has tried hard to make it very small, fast, and modular. You only load the bare core when you include the YUI base js (although you can if you want load more via the configurator) and when you need more functionality, you can fetch it on the fly and avoid having long initial download times for your page."

-   **[Evan Goer (@evangoer), "YUI 3 Grids Are Dead Simple"](http://www.goer.org/Journal/2010/10/yui_3_grids_are_dead_simple.html):** Evan likes Matt Sweeney's [YUI 3 Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/cssgrids/), which debuted in beta in YUI 3.2.0. Writes Evan: "Not only is this version tiny (1.5 KB), but it’s the first layout system I’ve ever used where I can just write out whatever grid I want from memory, without ever needing to look at the docs."

-   **[Saurabh Odhyan on the YUI 3 Cache Utility](http://odhyan.com/blog/2010/09/caching-in-javascript-yui-cache/):** Writes Saurabh: YUI 3 Cache "allows to cache frequently used data in javascript memory (Basic caching) or HTML5 localStorage object (Offline caching). Although we can implement our own caching mechanism in javascript, the YUI caching is general purpose and also provides a set of events. Moreover it can be easily integrated with YUI Datasource which can be very beneficial. I’ll show you how useful YUI caching utility can be using a very standard example, Factorial."

-   **[Sidnei Da Silva, "Even Faster Websites with YUI"](http://blog.sidneidasilva.com/2010/10/01/even-faster-web-sites-with-yui/):** Writes Sidnei: "Ever since I got my copy of Steve Souders’ Even Faster Web Sites I’ve became obsessed with speed. During my day job I’m constantly looking for things that can be improved to make the user experience smoother, specially for first-time visitors. I’m fairly happy with what we’ve achieved in the last year, though there are always things to be improved. Today I’m going to share with you one of the tricks that we’ve discovered almost by accident and that can help with making your website faster, if YUI is your Javascript framework of choice."
