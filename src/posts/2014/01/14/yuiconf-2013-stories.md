During YUIConf 2013, members of the community were asked to give a brief interview detailing why they chose YUI. Lots of folks responded and we created [a video showing some of the highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqui-O59OcU), along with scenes from the conference. If you weren't able to attend this year, you should definitely check it out. And if you did attend, you may just catch a glimpse of yourself in the video!

A big thanks go out to [Ajay Fay](http://www.ajayfayphotography.com/) for editing and producing this.

UPDATE: We received an revised version of the video and have updated the links in this post.
