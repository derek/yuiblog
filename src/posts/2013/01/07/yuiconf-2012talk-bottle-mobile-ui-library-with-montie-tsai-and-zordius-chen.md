One of the themes of [YUIConf 2012](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf) was that YUI is a robust platform to build upon and extend. This is precisely what the folks in the Yahoo! mobile e-commerce team did with [Bottle](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/bottle). After you check out the video below, be sure to [take a look at their code](http://zordius.github.com/yui3-gallery/gallery-bottle/) and give it a try yourself. You can watch all of the released videos from YUIConf 2012 on [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/) or [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByU2zn9DmAA&list=PLjKP9DUCzZooMmiSJ_nmsLIReOZp0Uomz).

In this YUIConf 2012 talk, Montie Tsai and Zordius Chen, Yahoo! mobile e-commerce engineers, discuss a mobile UI library called Bottle that features components packaged as YUI widgets for better reusability. The library is available in the [YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/).
