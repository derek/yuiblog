[![Stoyan Stefanov's 'Object Oriented JavaScript' [book cover]](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/oojs-cover.png)](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/pdf/oojs-ch-8.pdf)[Stoyan Stefanov](http://www.phpied.com/) is a member of Yahoo's [Exceptional Performance](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/) team; he's worked on a variety of performance-related projects at Yahoo, including the popular [YSlow plugin for Firebug](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/). He's also a [contributing author here on YUIBlog](/yuiblog/blog/2008/07/22/non-blocking-scripts/).

Stoyan's latest project is [_Object Oriented JavaScript_](http://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-javascript-applications-libraries/book), a new book from Packt whose simple goal is to help you learn how to "think in JavaScript." Stoyan and his editors were kind enough to let us share with you Chapter 8 from _OOJS_ — "Coding and Design Patterns."

-   [**Chapter 8 from _Object Oriented JavaScript_ by Stoyan Stefanov: "Coding and Design Patterns" (1.8MB PDF)**](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/pdf/oojs-ch-8.pdf)

Among the coding patterns explored in this chapter:

-   Separating behavior
-   Namespaces
-   Init-time branching
-   Lazy deﬁnition
-   Conﬁguration objects
-   Private variables and methods
-   Privileged methods
-   Private functions as public methods
-   Self-executable functions
-   Chaining
-   JSON

Design patterns include:

-   Singleton
-   Factory
-   Decorator
-   Observer

The [sample chapter](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/pdf/oojs-ch-8.pdf) is an excellent standalone resource, but the [full volume](http://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-javascript-applications-libraries/book) is outstanding as well. Our thanks to Stoyan and his editors for allowing us to freely share the coding and design patterns content here.
