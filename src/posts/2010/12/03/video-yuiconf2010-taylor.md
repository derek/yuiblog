[![Yahoo! engineer Matt Taylor speaks at YUIConf 2010 at Yahoo! HQ in Sunnyvale, CA.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf2010-taylor-20101130-082547.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-taylor)

Most web application frameworks have some type of templating engine that accepts two things: (1) data, (2) template, and returns HTML to be assembled into an HTTPResponse. The promise of Node.js and YUI 3 running server-side is that a new era of frameworks is possible in which view rendering on the client and server is implemented with the same JavaScript-based code. In this session from [YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/), Yahoo! engineer Matt Taylor ([@rhyolight](http://twitter.com/rhyolight/)) talks about this unification of view rendering and illustrates it with detailed examples.
