**Update:** There was an issue with the downloadable `.zip` package that prevented successful extraction that has now been fixed.

We are releasing YUI **3.10.3** today to fix a `.swf` vulnerability that was inadvertantly reintroduced in YUI **3.10.2**. Any project which is self-hosting the YUI **3.10.2** `io.swf` file should upgrade to YUI **3.10.3** to resolve the vulnerability. Any project which is not self-hosting the YUI **3.10.2** `io.swf` file is not affected by the vulnerability.

You can find YUI **3.10.3** on [CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.10.3/build/yui/yui-min.js), as a [download](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.10.3.zip), and on [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/yui).

## Details

We released YUI **3.10.1** last month to [correct a `.swf` vulnerability](/yuiblog/2013/05/14/yui-3-10-1-released-to-fix-swf-vulnerability/). Unfortunately within the **3.10.2** release cycle, one of the older vulnerable `.swf` files (`io.swf`) was inadvertently reintroduced to the source tree and distributed in our latest **3.10.2** release in the npm and downloadable `.zip` packages.

YUI **3.10.3** replaces the vulnerable `.swf` with the correct patched file, and no other code changes have been included with this release. Note: This is _not_ a new vulnerability, just a reintroduction of an older `.swf` file that contained the original vulnerability.

Full details of the original vulnerability are available in the [security bulletin](http://yuilibrary.com/support/20130515-vulnerability/).

**Note:** This vulnerability is also listed under [CVE-2013-4939](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4939), [CVE-2013-4940](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4940), [CVE-2013-4941](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4941), and [CVE-2013-4942](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4942).

## Resolution

### Delete the File

If you are hosting `io.swf` but not using it in your application, simply delete the file to resolve the vulnerability.

### Replace the Vulnerable Files

If you host and use this functionality, replace `io.swf` with the patched file provided below.

## Plan To Remove All Flash-Based Features

In the future, we plan to remove all Flash-based features from the yui3 repo and instead host the source code in a separate [yui3-swfs repo](https://github.com/yui/yui3-swfs). This will allow projects continued access to the functionality via a compile-yourself and host-yourself model, while removing these problematic features from the core project. We are requesting [community feedback on this topic](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/yui-contrib/swf/yui-contrib/_SaE7C8Asks/lHxiymAEYeMJ) on the mailing list.
