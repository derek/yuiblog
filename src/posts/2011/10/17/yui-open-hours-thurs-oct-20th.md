### Modules and Loaders inside and outside of YUI

Authoring JavaScript in modules is definitely picking up steam these days, and I'm not just talking about YUI. Node.js uses CommonJS 1.1 modules, dojo and others use AMD, and the next version of JavaScript (ok, ECMAScript) will include new syntax for creating and working with modules.

So where is YUI in all this? By and large, all the folks espousing the glory of modules are singing in chorus. The devil's in the details. But as long as there are different implementations out there, interoperability is a genuine concern, so let's talk about that.

If you've worked with other module formats and loaders, please join us. If you haven't, please join us anyway!
