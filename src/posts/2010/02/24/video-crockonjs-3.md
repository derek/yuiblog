[![Douglas Crockford delivers the third lecture in his his Crockford on JavaScript lecture series at Yahoo on February 17, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/crockonjs-3-20100222-121544.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockonjs-3)

The third installment of the [Crockford on JavaScript](/yuiblog/crockford/) series provides a deep-dive on functions in JavaScript. Douglas begins the talk this way:

> We're going to be talking about functions tonight. Functions are the very best part of JavaScript. It's where most of the power is, it's where the beauty is. Like everything else in JavaScript, they're not quite right, but you can work around that, and there's a lot of good stuff here.

73 minutes later, you'll have a better understanding of functions — and a deeper understanding of what makes JavaScript both unique and powerful. If you missed either of the first two lectures in the series, or if you want to attend one of the two remaining, visit the [Crockford on JavaScript](/yuiblog/crockford/) series page.
