As we get ready for [YUIConf 2010](http://yuiconf2010.eventbrite.com/) and a lot more in the coming months, here are some of the other things we've taken note of in the larger YUI world:

-   **[YUI Theater Tops NetTuts List of Must-see F2E Podcasts](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/top-15-podcasts-all-web-developers-should-follow/):** Andrew Burgess writes about [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater): "It seems that as often as a few times a month, Yahoo! brings in developers on the cutting edge of web technology to keep their employees up to date. For the benefit of the rest of us, these talks are recorded and published. You’ll find well-known devs like Douglas Crockford and Nicholas Zakas, and talks on everything from performance and accessibility to JavaScript and the DOM." [#](#yuiBlogWild-520)

-   **[Progressive Enhancement Using Nothing but JS (@codepo8 on @davglass)](http://ajaxian.com/archives/progressive-enhancement-using-nothing-but-javascript):** Christian Heilmann writes on Ajaxian: "Progressive enhancement is still a confusing matter for a lot of people who are very excited about the capabilities of JavaScript in modern browser environments. It can feel anachronistic to write your solutions for a non-JS environment and then once more enhances in JavaScript. I grew up like that so for me it is a simple matter of doing the right thing but with today’s world of JavaScript libraries and out-of-the-box widgets it can seem a drag. Enter Dav Glass of the YUI team. He’s been turning the concept of progressive enhancement around in his head and as a JS lover and backend code “endurer” he set out to solve this issue once and for all in a pure JavaScript way."
