[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/aptana_yui.png)](http://www.aptana.com/blog/lorihc/yui2.6_released)Aptana sent a clear signal about how committed it was to the needs of frontend engineers when it hired [Lori Hylan-Cho](http://www.avocado8.com/blog/) to work specifically on support in the Aptana IDE for popular frontend libraries. This is a challenging task, given the complexity of the library landscape. But these libraries (like YUI and jQuery) are an important asset for developers of web applications, and Aptana has shown that it's going the extra mile for those developers.

Lori, working with Jon Ferraiolo, already has [YUI 2.6.0](/yuiblog/2008/10/01/yui-260/) support built out for Aptana, and it's a huge step forward from previous YUI plugins. Support is now provided across the full spectrum of YUI components and is driven by the same data that we use to build out our API documentation. [Here's Lori writing about the plugin on her Aptana blog](http://www.aptana.com/blog/lorihc/yui2.6_released):

The Yahoo! User Interface Library, better known as YUI, version 2.6.0 was released earlier this month, and is now supported by Aptana Studio. YUI 2.6.0 includes numerous fixes, enhancements, and optimizations; introduces a new [Carousel Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/carousel/); breaks the [Paginator Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/paginator/) out from [DataTable](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/); and makes final eight components that were previously designated beta.

In addition, YUI 2.6.0 also includes a huge number of functional examples—all of which are available, along with code assist, code completion, built-in API documentation, and more, when you install the YUI 2.6.0 plugin for Aptana Studio.

Many thanks to Lori, Jon and the whole Aptana team for this work (which extends beyond YUI to many other popular JavaScript libraries). You can get started with the enhanced YUI support by downloading the free [Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/studio).
