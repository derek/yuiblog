[Gonzalo has posted details on the April 2010 BayJax meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/calendar/13107337/ "High performance JavaScript -  BayJax - The Bay Area Ajax and JavaScript Meetup (Palo Alto, CA) - Meetup.com"), which we'll be hosting at Yahoo! again next week:

> We are back with the first Bayjax meetup of the new year at Yahoo!. This month we are bringing you an extraordinary lineup of speakers on JavaScript performance. In celebration of the newly released book _High Performance JavaScript_, Yahoo! front-end engineers Nicholas Zakas, Matt Sweeney, Julien Lecomte, Stoyan Stefanov, and Ross Harmes will be covering some of the most relevant topics, tools, and techniques for producing screamingly fast web applications.
