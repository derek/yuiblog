_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   As [mentioned on yui-contrib](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/FHK01-I9lsk) earlier this week, the scheduled release of YUI 3.10 has been delayed by at least one week. This was due to the late discovery of a few bugs, some issues with our release system, and the team needed a few additional days to patch things up. Expect some news next Monday about the updated release date. If you are anxious to get started with 3.10, check out last week's [3.10pr1](/yuiblog/blog/2013/04/08/yui-3-10pr1/).
    
-   [brackets-xunit](https://github.com/dschaffe/brackets-xunit) is an extension for the [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) code editor which can both execute YUI tests (in addition to [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/)), as well as generate them too. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcxx49RoZP8) for a demo.
    
-   This week's Open Roundtable ([YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UklloDVeCeU)) featured discussions on the 72-hour review window, alternatives platforms for bug tracking and discussion forums, [Paginator](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/466), [pull requests](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pulls), and [unassigned bugs](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/146)
    
-   Activity on the [yui-contrib](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/yui-contrib) mailing list this week included Juan Dopazo's ([@juandopazo](https://twitter.com/juandopazo)) [storage module design doc](https://gist.github.com/juandopazo/5405383), in addition to continued discussion on detecting and resolving [memory leaks](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/J7vbPMRtMpo). [leakutils.js](https://gist.github.com/Satyam/5404590) is a YUI module that can help you detect Node-based memory leaks in your YUI app.
    
-   Version bumps this week for the following YUI devtools: [Shifter](https://github.com/yui/Shifter) to 0.3.3, and [YUI Doc](https://github.com/yui/yuidoc/) to 0.3.44. Shifter now supports a `--no-assets` option to disable skin building and asset copying.
    
-   Updated [Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) modules include: [list-format](https://github.com/ashiksmd/i18n-formats/tree/master/src/gallery-list-format) and [itsadatetimepicker](https://github.com/ItsAsbreuk/yui3-gallery/tree/master/src/gallery-itsadatetimepicker)
