### Yahoo! Search Direct code review

Late last month, the Yahoo! Search team [launched a new feature called Search Direct](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/03/searchdirect/) that aims to give answers (not just search result links) as you type into a search field. Our good friend [Caridy Patiño](http://twitter.com/caridy) had a hand in its making—as did YUI 3—so we figured we'd get him on the call to talk about how it was built.![](http://ydn.zenfs.com/blogs/1/weather_med.jpg)

For high traffic sites like Yahoo!, adding highly dynamic features like Search Direct has to be thoroughly reviewed and performance tuned. And as a platform solution, it also had to be architected to be flexible and future compatible. In short, there should be plenty of examples of best practices and YUI 3 development patterns to be shared.

Let's look under the hood.
