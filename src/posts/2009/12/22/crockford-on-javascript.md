Since 2007, Douglas Crockford has been developing (and delivering) a lecture series on the JavaScript programming language. Many of those lectures have been recorded and made available as part of the [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) video series. Douglas has delivered many of the talks at conferences around the world.

In the first few months of 2010, Douglas will be delivering the full series of JavaScript talks with updated content as part of an event entitled ["Crockford on JavaScript"](/yuiblog/crockford/). The event will take place over five evenings in January, February, and March at Yahoo! headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA. Attendance is free, but seating is limited — a full schedule including links to RSVP is available on the [event website](/yuiblog/crockford/).
