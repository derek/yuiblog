For those of you that don't subscribe to the [YUI calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/calendar/#calendar) or [YUILibrary.com forum](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/), the next installment of [YUI: Open Hours](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/08/introducing-yui-open-hours/) will be this Wednesday the 4th.

This time our topic will be testing testing testing. And who better to have with us to discuss testing than [Nicholas C. Zakas](http://www.nczonline.net/) ([@slicknet](http://twitter.com/slicknet)), author of the [YUI Test](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/test/) module. We'll talk about the why, when, and how to set up your JavaScript testing, how to simulate user interaction, and what sort of automation tools and strategies you have available today.

Reid Burke ([@reid](http://twitter.com/reid)), the newest member of the YUI team, will also be joining us to share his own experience with raising the bar on testing inside YUI and share where we're headed.

As a hands on exercise, Nicholas will be creating sample tests and exploring some tests for a YUI Gallery module as he talks about the goals of writing test suites and test cases.

As usual, we'll be online from 10am to 12pm PDT. The connection details are the same as usual.
