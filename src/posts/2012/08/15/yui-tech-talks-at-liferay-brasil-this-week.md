The YUI Community is growing! [Liferay Brazil](http://www.liferay.com/) is hosting a roundtable event, open to the public, in order to discuss the lifecycle of front-end development and show off YUI features that go beyond jQuery development. This is a great opportunity to get the community together in Brazil's Pernambuco state.

The tech talk, given by [Eduardo Lundgren](https://twitter.com/eduardolundgren), [Djalma Araujo](https://twitter.com/djalmaaraujo), and [Zeno Rocha](https://twitter.com/zenorocha), will be offered twice due to popular demand: once on Wednesday, August 15, 2012 and again on Thursday, Aug 16, 2012, both at the same time, 08:00 PM (BRT) at Liferay Brazil's Recife office.

Agenda:

-   Introduction
-   Front-end development lifecycle
-   Introduction to YUI 3
-   How to develop a full application with YUI 3
-   Showcase
