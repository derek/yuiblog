It's time again for [YUI: Open Hours](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/08/introducing-yui-open-hours/)! A change of schedule this week, though. **The call will be on Wednesday**.

I want to start by sending a huge thanks to Iliyan Peychev, [Andrew Bialecki](http://twitter.com/abialecki), [Matt Snider](http://www.mattsnider.com/), and [Jacob Fogg](http://twitter.com/jacobfogg) for featuring their Gallery widgets in the last Open Hours. From Matt's game UI inspired [Radial Menu](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/radialmenu) to Iliyan's full featured [Accordion](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/accordion), it was a great exploration of the types of UI tools you can find (or create) in the Gallery today as well as a study in different ways to use YUI 3 to solve UI challenges. You can find links to the modules [in the May 21st Open Hours post](/yuiblog/blog/2010/05/19/yui-open-hours-fri-may-21st/), and a sampling of some of the interesting points from the discussion [in the comments](/yuiblog/blog/2010/05/19/yui-open-hours-fri-may-21st/#comment-591682).

This week, hot on the heels of their [huge YUI 3 Gallery contribution](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/user/liferay), [Nate Cavanaugh](http://twitter.com/natecavanaugh) and [Eduardo Lundgren](http://twitter.com/eduardolundgren) of [Liferay, Inc.](http://liferay.com/) will be joining us to introduce us to some of the new AlloyUI modules. This is a pretty big deal. We've been working with these guys for months to get their 65 modules into the Gallery. That's right, 65 modules! All created by just Nate and Eduardo. Talk about productive.

Obviously we'll barely have time to scratch the surface of all the AlloyUI modules, but we will do a quick overview of some of the most interesting or popular ones and cover some "Getting started" code. There's such a variety of modules, there will be something for everyone.

-   For YUI 3 newcomers or folks that have been waiting for the YUI 2 widgets to be migrated, there are now a lot more options to check out.
-   For people wanting to take those first steps creating something in YUI 3, there are now more things to write plugins for, patch, or extend.
-   For seasoned component developers, there's now a lot more implementation code to reference for evolving conventions and components to collaborate on.
-   For more complex app developers, you can get a sense of one team's strategy for code submodularization and approach for building and packaging modules in a larger or more complex application.

Nate and Eduardo are open to whatever questions you have, so the conversation can go however deep, and in whichever direction you want. If you have any questions about a particular module or about anything else, ask away.

We're changing up a little this week and **moving Open Hours to Wednesday**. The time will be the same as before, though (10am - 12pm PDT), and the connection details are also the same:

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (non-US participants, email me for a local number)
2.  Enter the attendee code 4718 8953#
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

And as always, you can keep up to date with the upcoming schedule and topics by following [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) on Twitter or subscribing to the [YUI Event Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/calendar/#calendar).

Hope to see you there!
