[![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/112/258216032_ee6bfdb32d_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dantekgeek/258216032/)For the past few years, one of our favorite Yahoo events has been Open Hack Day. From worn out hackers [napping in the Official YUI Radio Flyer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dantekgeek/258216032/) back in 2006 to the [hair-raising quantities of Red Bull and hacker food](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yodelanecdotal/257037717/) we've seen consumed in the years since, the event has always brought out the best in Yahoo! and the developers who come to invent cool stuff.

This year, the [Yahoo Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.com/)'s [Havi Hoffman](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/98609754/) has been leading the charge, and the event is being staged near Times Square in New York. From the YUI engineering team, Isaac Schlueter will be there giving a talk on the [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) toolkit and how to think through a project making use of it. Clay Shirky will be keynoting — one of the truly singular thinkers in the technosphere. And there will be a host of other great speakers.

And it's a Yahoo! Hack Day, which means it will be interesting, surprising, and serendipitous. [We hope you'll consider joining us as we renew the tradition](http://guest.cvent.com/Events/Info/Custom.aspx?cid=18&e=085d1b5c-ba31-4bf0-85de-592ee3b61694).

From [YDN](http://developer.yahoo.com/):

> On Friday, The Developer Conference opens with a keynote by [**Clay Shirky**](http://www.shirky.com). A day of tech talks and hands-on workshops will cover a range of open technologies including the [Yahoo! Application Platform](/yap/) and [Social APIs](/social/), [YQL](/yql/), and [Connected TV](http://connectedtv.yahoo.com/developer). Our 24-hour Hack session kicks off Friday afternoon. On Saturday, hackers will demo their hacks for a chance at glory and cool prizes.
