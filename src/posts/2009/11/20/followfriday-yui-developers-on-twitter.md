[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yui-devs-on_twitter-20091120-110146.png)](http://twitter.com/miraglia/yui/members) The [@YUILibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) account on Twitter is a good information source for those of us who follow the project. Many of the individual developers who write YUI code every day are now on the service as well, and I wanted to gather all those accounts together in a single post for the sake of convenience.

[Here's the formal list](http://twitter.com/miraglia/yui/members), which you can follow as a group, and here are the individual accounts:
