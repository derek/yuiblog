## More Information

We also want to thank our two Summer Interns [Patrick Jameson](https://github.com/patjameson) and [Rashad Russell](https://github.com/rashadrussell) for all their hard work these past few months. They've been a great help in testing and debugging issues for this release.

There were a total of **255** commits for this release by **24** contributors. You can read all about the details in the [Change History Rollup](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/YUI-3.12.0-Change-History-Rollup) and [compare it on GitHub](https://github.com/yui/yui3/compare/v3.11.0...v3.12.0) with **YUI 3.11.0**. We are always seeking ways to make our releases better, whether it's improved CI (almost 9,000 tests per target environment) , better release processes (our new release branch keeps the main branches open all the time now), or more community involvement. Please [file an issue](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/newticket/) if you find something we can improve!
