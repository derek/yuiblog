It's time again for the another installment of [YUI: Open Hours](/yuiblog/2010/04/08/introducing-yui-open-hours/)!

This week, we'll be joined by [Caridy Patiño](http://twitter.com/caridy), author of the outstanding [YUI Bubbling Library](http://bubbling-library.com/) for YUI 2. We'll have a look at some of the work he's been doing migrating the Bubbling Library components to YUI 3, other modules and features he has in the Gallery already, and what new stuff he's working on these days.

Thanks again to [Eric Ferraiuolo](http://twitter.com/ericf) for joining us last time and reviewing his work on the [Component Manager utility](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/base-componentmgr) and talking about some of the more brain melting points of application infrastructure development with YUI 3. A lot of great info about some of the features of YUI's event system and infrastructure pieces came out of the discussion.

We'll try to come back up to the surface a bit this week and address more specific problem spaces and UI patterns. But before we dive in with Caridy, we're going to do a quick run through the `YUI.add(...)` method and how to create JavaScript classes in a YUI 3 world. Then it will be all Caridy, showing off a whole lot of flashy YUI 3 goodness. The conversation will no doubt touch on some points about migrating code from YUI 2 to 3 and some best practices when creating classes and modules.

The time will be the same as before, 10am - 12pm PDT and the connection details are also the same. Here they are for review:
