### 3.5.0 release retrospective and 3.6.0 planning

[3.5.0 is live](/yuiblog/2012/04/10/announcing-yui-3-5-0/)! That means 3.6.0 development is now underway and we want your feedback on what **you** think should be the high priority features and components of our next release.

We can also talk about what _didn't_ make it into 3.5.0, and what work is currently assigned to the 3.6.0 PR1 sprint, scheduled for released May 8.

### Recording

The recording is [available in the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEqFv1xHkP4).
