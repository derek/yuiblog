[YUIConf 2013](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/) is coming very soon and we want you to be a speaker! If you are working with YUI in any capacity and want to speak about it you are invited to submit a talk proposal. Simply email _yui-events_ (at) _yahoo-inc.com_ and include the following information:

-   **Title**
-   **Description**
-   **Intended audience**
-   **Your name**
-   **A brief bio**
-   **Other info (any previous talks? papers? is this your first talk?)**

If your talk gets accepted, we’ll refund your conference ticket and trade it in for a VIP one!

While you have some time to think of a topic, don't delay because the deadline for submitting a proposal is **October 11**. If you know you wish to speak at the conference, but are not sure of your final topic, submit a proposal now with as much detail as you have.
