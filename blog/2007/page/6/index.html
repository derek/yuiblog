The YUI project and YUIBlog continue to focus on that mission and on that fundamental paradigm.</p>
<p>Yahoo! announced yesterday another initiative related to frontend engineering &mdash; <a href="http://www.yswfblog.com/">a new blog, the Yahoo! Flash Blog</a>, that will be the voice of the Yahoo! Flash&reg; Platform Team and a focal point for information about libraries and tools that the team develops and issues under an open-source license on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/flash/">Flash Developer Center</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Flash Platform team is developing the technical strategy and policy for Adobe technologies as it applies to Yahoo!. As such, we are focusing on developing libraries and platform solutions, methodologies and practices, as well as looking into emerging Adobe technologies.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>All of our libraries are planned to be released as open source, under a BSD license on the Yahoo! Developer Network and will be free for all uses. We would like to encourage you and the community to participate in active discussions and sharing code and solutions, because we believe it will help us to create better products — and do it faster.</p></blockquote>

				<small>August 13, 2007 at 12:07 pm by Dav Glass | In <a href="/yuiblog/blog/category/development/" title="View all posts in Development" rel="category tag">Development</a> | <a href="/yuiblog/blog/2007/08/13/rte-notes/#comments" title="Comment on Some Notes on the YUI Rich Text Editor">42 Comments</a></small>
						
			<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/rte.gif" alt="The YUI Rich Text Editor" width="520" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>About a year ago I made a <a href="http://blog.davglass.com/files/yui/editor/" title="RTE Prototype">Rich Text Editor (RTE) prototype</a> to show that it was possible to build one on top of YUI. Of all <a href="http://blog.davglass.com/2006/06/yui-code-samples/">my YUI examples</a>, it quickly became one of the most requested, and the project indirectly resulted in me joining the YUI team in a formal capacity.</p>
<p>Once I started on the YUI team, building a full-featured <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/">YUI Rich Text Editor</a> became my top priority. Even though there are many DHTML-based RTEs available in the open-source world, including <a href="http://www.moxiecode.com/">Moxiecode&#8217;s</a> excellent <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a>, there were four key reasons I took on the challenge of building a new one for YUI.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A-Grade browser support</strong> &#8211; Most available RTEs fail to support the full spectrum of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/">A-Grade web browsers</a>. Most support IE and Firefox well, but few support Opera and I&#8217;m not aware of any that fully support Safari. For example, many existing RTEs don&#8217;t offer list editing in Safari. I thought we could do better. Because YUI is committed to A-Grade browser support (and because I&#8217;m a fanatic Mac user) fully supporting Safari was a top priority for me. Wrestling Safari into submission was no small task, and I&#8217;ll look at some of the specific challenges below.</li>
<li><strong>Extensibility</strong> &#8211; I wanted to build an editor that would allow fellow developers to add their own unique functionality. The YUI Rich Text Editor&#8217;s Toolbar is designed from the ground up to be extensible; the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/editor/flickr_editor.html">Flickr example</a> is meant to illustrate this, as is the example of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/editor/cal_editor.html">Calendar Control</a> implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> &#8211; What happens when users employing assistive technologies are presented with a rich-text-editing interface? What should happen? I spent time working with Yahoo! accessibility specialist Victor Tsaran to answer those questions. I believe that I have engineered some of the answers into the YUI Rich Text Editor. This is an area of ongoing development, and I&#8217;ll share more details as the RTE progresses out of Beta status.</li>
<li><strong>Footprint and Performance</strong> &#8211; I wanted to build an RTE that was small and fast. It&#8217;s already lighter-weight than some, but let&#8217;s be clear: <em>It is not there yet</em>.  You can count on the fact that I&#8217;ll be putting a lot of effort into shrinking its footprint and improving its performance, while maintaining (and improving) consistency across the A-Grade browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Current and Future Status</h2>
<p>Before I get into the fundamentals of the YUI RTE, let me give you an update on the state of the project. First, this editor is currently a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/faq/#beta">Beta control</a>, and as such there is still much work to be done. Second, it&#8217;s neither a site editor nor a development environment. It&#8217;s designed for simple things like web mail systems, blog posts and comments, online reviews, and so forth. However, I did try to expose as many hooks and events as possible so that others could build upon the basic A-grade browser foundation that the RTE provides.</p>
<h2>The Development Path</h2>
<p>My development approach was to bend Safari first. I built it to work in Safari 2 before retrofitting it back to Opera, then Firefox and lastly Internet Explorer. I figured that if I could make Safari do what I wanted, the other three would fall into place nicely. And they did.  By choosing to make Safari work first I was able to make the others do things in a standard way as well. I hope that Safari will eventually catch up to its A-grade peers and add support for the things that I have &#8220;emulated&#8221;, so I took that into consideration too.</p>
<h3>Hacking Around Safari</h3>
<p>Safari 2 is a really good browser, but it was also the most challenging browser to support with the RTE project. It lacks some serious and critical features when it comes to editing HTML content from JavaScript. I will try to explain the main hurdles that Safari presents:</p>
<p><strong>Iframe Focus</strong> &#8211; One of the biggest issues was actually quite simple to solve. Safari (and Internet Explorer) has an issue with selecting text inside of an embedded iframe. If you select  text within the editor&#8217;s iframe then click/focus the parent document, the selection within the iframe is lost. Clearly, this makes it rather difficult for a button click to take action on the selection (because the selection is lost when you click the button!). It also makes it difficult to use, say, a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/">YUI Menu Control</a> for a drop down. As I investigated this problem, I determined that if you stop the mousedown event on the button/href the selection doesn&#8217;t get lost. However, if something else (say a href in a dropdown menu) gets focus, the selection will still get lost. This leads me to the next Safari trick.</p>
<p><strong>Selection Object</strong> &#8211; The selection object in Safari is very limited (to say the least). To work around its limitations, the YUI RTE caches a copy of the current selection in the <code>_getSelection</code> method. Then, the next time <code>_getSelection</code> is called I  check to see if a cache existed. If the cache is there, I  &#8220;rebuild&#8221; the selection and destroy the cached copy. This little trick is what lets Safari use a YUI Overlay as a menu instead of the more classic approach of a select element. It&#8217;s roundabout, but it works.</p>
<p><strong>execCommand limitations</strong> &#8211; This is the mother of all hacks for Safari (and the others). My biggest problem with the native <code>execCommand</code> method (in all browsers) is that the browser doesn&#8217;t tell you what it applied the command to. So there is no real way to get an element reference back after running a command on a selection. The world of JavaScript editors would be so much more civilized if this would happen (<em>hint, hint, nudge, nudge</em>). So what I had to do was implement this feature myself. My current approach may not be the best way to do it (I have some other ideas that I am working through), but it does the job for now. The method is named <code>_createCurrentElement</code> and basically it runs <code>execCommand('fontname', false, 'yui-tmp');</code> on the given selection (since fontname is supported on all A-Grade browsers). It will then search the document for an element with the font-family/name set to <code>yui-tmp</code> and replace that with a span that has other information in it (attributes about the element that we wanted to create), then it will add the new span to the <code>this.currentElement</code> array, so we now have element references to the elements that were just modified. At this point we can use standard DOM manipulation to change them as we see fit. In short, I&#8217;m using the iframe&#8217;s DOM to store metadata during editing as a way to enrich the communication that&#8217;s possible between the editor and the iframe. </p>
<h3>Making it Your Way</h3>
<p>Over the past few years I&#8217;ve implemented many of the available RTEs. Because of this I brought a &#8220;taste of your own medicine&#8221; mentality to the table. I wanted to build an editor that was easy to extend and change. The YUI RTE has <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/#customevent">Custom Events</a> for everything that I could think of! I made all of the event handlers standalone functions that can be overloaded on the instance or on the prototype. I also tried to make as many things configurable as possible.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea, let me show you a quick way to change one of the editor&#8217;s default behaviors.</p>
<p><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/rte-link-editor.gif" alt="Editing links in the YUI RTE." width="520" height="445" /></p>
<p><strong>The Create Link Dialog</strong> &#8211; Say you want to use a different input utility for link creation (a pre-defined links list maybe?) instead of the default link editor. Well, here&#8217;s some sample code to turn it into a JavaScript prompt:</p>
<pre>
var oEditor = new YAHOO.widget.Editor('demo');
oEditor._handleCreateLinkClick = function() {
    oEditor.on('afterExecCommand', function() {
        var str = prompt('URL: ', 'link');
        var el = this.currentElement[0].setAttribute('href', str);
    }, oEditor, this);
};
</pre>
<p>Using this technique, you could easily write your own property editor. By the way, the &#8220;insert image&#8221; dialog can be overridden in exactly the same way (for example to make it a photo picker), just override the <code>_handleInsertImageClick</code> method. You could either override it as above, or you could override all editor instances (so every editor on the page would behave the same) like this:</p>
<pre>
YAHOO.widget.Editor.prototype._handleCreateLinkClick = function() {
};</pre>
<h2>The Look and Feel</h2>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the visual design of the RTE, simply change the CSS. As with YUI&#8217;s entire family of controls, the visual presentation of the control is written in CSS and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/skinning/">can be reskinned to suit your implementation</a>. See the RTE&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/editor/skinning_editor.html">skinning example</a> for more information on how CSS controls the presentation of the RTE specifically. We&#8217;ve even provided the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/assets/rte-skinning.zip">Photoshop source file</a> for the icons to make it easier for you to create a design that&#8217;s customized for your site. Maybe you like the colors, but you don&#8217;t want to see the labels above the &#8220;groups&#8221;? Well, add these few lines of CSS:</p>
<pre>
.yui-skin-sam .yui-toolbar-container .yui-toolbar-group h3 {
	display: none;
}
.yui-skin-sam .yui-toolbar-container .yui-toolbar-group {
	margin-top: .75em;
}</pre>
<p>Once you dig in, I think you will find that the YUI RTE is pretty flexible and easy to extend.</p>
<h2>In the End</h2>
<p>Safari was tough, but I&#8217;m stubborn. When Safari properly supports execCommand, things will be even better. YUI&#8217;s RTE is exceptionally extensible and customizable; from very low-level functionality all the way up through the visual layer. It&#8217;s also semi-lightweight, and will be even lighter before I&#8217;m done with it.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy my first YUI control. Please keep the feedback coming.</p>

			<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/"><img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/ydn/yuiweb/download_1.gif" width="108" height="23" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="YUI 2.3.0 is now available as a download from SourceForge."></a>We&#8217;re pleased to announce today the release of YUI version 2.3.0. This release features six new additions to the library as well as a new skinning architecture and a new visual treatment for most of our UI controls. All of this, plus 250 enhancements and bug fixes, is <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/">available for download immediately</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new to YUI in version 2.3.0:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rich Text Editor (beta):  </strong>YUI developer <a href="http://blog.davglass.com/2006/06/yui-code-samples/">Dav Glass</a> brings you the new  <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/">YUI RTE,</a> featuring rich-text editing with robust <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/">A-Grade browser support</a>. Cross-browser support has always been a major challenge for RTEs, and we think you&#8217;ll be impressed with how well this editor works across the various environments.  You can instantiate it with just a few lines of code for simple implementations, and when you need to go beyond the ordinary it&#8217;s easy to extend the RTE&#8217;s Toolbar with your own custom buttons.      <br />
    <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/editor/flickr_editor.html"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/rte.gif" alt="Try out the YUI RTE with a custom Flickr photo extension." width="520" border="0" /></a></li>
<li><strong>Base CSS:</strong> <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">Nate Koechley</a> continues to extend and refine the  YUI CSS foundation, which now includes four members &mdash; <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">Reset CSS</a> neutralizes browser CSS treatments; the new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/base/">Base CSS</a> applies some consistent and common style treatments that many developers use as a foundation; <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/">Fonts CSS</a> provides a foundation for typography; and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">Grids CSS</a> delivers CSS-driven wireframes for thousands of potential page designs.</li>
<li><strong>YUILoader Utility (beta):</strong>  YUI&#8217;s most prolific author Adam Moore has contributed the new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader">YUILoader Utility</a>, a mechanism for loading YUI components (and/or your own custom components) on the page via client-side script. YUILoader knows all about YUI&#8217;s dependency tree and introduces into the page only those files that are needed to support your desired components. <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/">It can load files from Yahoo! servers</a> or from your own hosted location.</li>
<li><strong>ImageLoader Utility (experimental): </strong>Yahoo! Travel engineer Matt Mlinac authored the new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imageloader/">YUI ImageLoader Utility</a>, which allows you to defer the loading of some images to speed initial rendering time on your pages. If you suspect that you&#8217;re serving a lot of images that are never actually seen by your users, you&#8217;ll want to check out Matt&#8217;s work on this clever utility. </li>
<li><strong>Color Picker Control (beta): </strong>Adam Moore built the new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/colorpicker/">YUI Color Picker Control</a> on top of his own Slider Control. The Color Picker provides a powerful UI widget for color selection, featuring HSV, RGB, and Hex input/output and a web-safe color-selection swatch.</li>
<li><strong>YUI Test Utility (beta):</strong> <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/">Nicholas C. Zakas</a>, who works on My Yahoo! when he&#8217;s not writing books or blogging on YUIBlog, authored our new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/">YUI Test Utility</a>. YUI Test introduces a flexible unit-testing framework for the YUI ecosystem and serves as the foundation for our own unit-test battery.</li>
</ol>
<h3>YUI Shows Some Skin</h3>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/skinning/"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/skin.gif" alt="The new YUI Sam Skin." width="300" height="289" border="0" align="right" /></a>YUI components have always been receptive to implementation-specific styling, but with 2.3.0 we&#8217;ve moved to a more formal <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/skinning/">skinning approach</a> that helps to separate core CSS definitions from purely presentational ones. YUI&#8217;s support for skinning makes it easier for you to implement your own design on top of, say, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/">TabView Control</a> &mdash; and it makes it easier to share that skin with others in the community.</p>
<p>In concert with that effort, Yahoo! designer Sam Lind pitched in over the past several months to help us create an attractive, consistent visual treatment for the many UI controls in YUI that ship with a default look-and-feel. This baseline skin is much more stylish than what we&#8217;ve shipped in the past; many thanks to Sam for his hard work.  In his honor, we&#8217;re calling this debut visual treatment the &quot;Sam Skin&quot;.  Hopefully this will be just the first of many YUI skins that evolve within the developer community as time goes on.</p>
<h3>More To Come</h3>
<p>The YUI Team will have  more to say over the coming weeks about what&#8217;s new in 2.3.0, including in-depth looks at the Rich Text Editor, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/skinning/">the skinning approach</a>, other new components, and Jenny Han&#8217;s significantly upgraded <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">DataTable Control</a>.  In the meantime, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/15989">George Puckett from the YUI team has posted a detailed release manifest to our forums</a> and there are release notes accompanying every component (available <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">on the website</a> and as part of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/">the download</a>).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working hard on YUI since the last release and we&#8217;re excited to share this work with everyone today.  Please check out the new version and let us know what you think.</p>

<p><a href="http://joehewitt.com/">Joe Hewitt</a>, co-founder of the Firefox project and author of the popular <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> extension to Firefox, stopped by Yahoo! last week to talk about his latest creation: the <a href="http://joehewitt.com/iui/">iUI JavaScript/CSS library</a> that allows developers to build web applications that emulate the visual language native iPhone applications.</p>
<p>In this 15-minute presentation, Joe provides an overview of how iUI works and how you can use it to jumpstart any iPhone-specific interfaces you&#8217;re considering for your web apps.  He also provides an outstanding overview of just what you can expect from the current iPhone web browser in terms of standards support; if you&#8217;re curious about what works and what doesn&#8217;t with iPhone&#8217;s Safari implementation, this is a  good place to start.</p>

				<small>July 9, 2007 at 10:24 am by Nicholas C. Zakas | In <a href="/yuiblog/blog/category/development/" title="View all posts in Development" rel="category tag">Development</a> | <a href="/yuiblog/blog/2007/07/09/downshift-your-code/#comments" title="Comment on Downshift Your Code">17 Comments</a></small>
						
			<p>Web browsers have advanced to the point where things happen fairly fast across the board. Events are fired fast, user interactions can be registered fast, code executes fast. All this speed is typically a good thing, as it keeps modern web applications zipping along at a steady clip. But sometimes fast is actually too fast. Sometimes, you simply can&#8217;t let something happen multiple times in a second due to complex calculations or major UI shifts that occur.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, consider the resize event. In most browsers, the resize event fires after the user has finished resizing the window, meaning that the event is fired once for each window resize. Internet Explorer, on the other hand, fires the resize event continuously as the user is resizing the browser. If you have anything more than some simple calculations being applied during onresize, it&#8217;s possible to end up confusing IE by having too much going on (especially if the event handler does any UI manipulations). The solution is to throttle your code so that a method is called a maximum number of times per second. This can be achieved using timeouts and a little bit of indirection. The basic pattern is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>
YAHOO.namespace("example");

YAHOO.example.MyObject = {

    _timeoutId : 0,
    _process : function () {
        //processing code goes here
    },

    process : function () {
        clearTimeout(this._timeoutId);
        var me = this;
        this._timeoutId = setTimeout(function(){
            me._process();
        }, 250);
    }
};
</code></pre>
<p>This object contains two &#8220;private&#8221; members, <code>_timeoutId</code> and <code>_process()</code>, which should not be accessed from outside of the object (if you want to make them truly private, you can use <a href="/yuiblog/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/">Crockford&#8217;s Module Pattern</a>). The <code>_timeoutId</code> property stores a timeout ID that is used to control how often <code>_process()</code>, the method doing all the processing, is called. The <code>process()</code> method is the one that should be called externally because it controls how often the processing can occur. The first step in this method is to clear the timeout represented by <code>_timeoutId</code>, then, it creates a new timeout to call <code>_process()</code>. This sequence makes it impossible for <code>_process()</code> to be called more frequently than every 250 milliseconds while assuring that <code>_process()</code> will be called no later than 250 milliseconds after the last call to <code>process()</code>. The maximum number of times <code>_process()</code> can be called is four times a second (using 250 milliseconds as the timeout period). You can, of course, adapt this time depending on your particular needs.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t recommended that you use this in all of your methods because the technique uses closures and does have a performance penalty. However, if you are having trouble because a certain method is being called too frequently, throttling the processing can result in significant performance improvements.</p>

	<img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/johnqsmith-wikia.jpg" width="167" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" />John Q. Smith is the VP of Engineering and Product for <a href="http://wikia.com/">Wikia</a>, a 2-year-old San Mateo-based startup founded by <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> co-founders Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley. Wikia is dedicated to the support and empowerment of passionate communities and to helping them grow on the web. Wikia itself is growing at a double-digit pace month-over-month in terms of content and traffic. Its communities are passionate and diverse, and the company has a tremendous track record of helping those communities succeed. </p>
<p>We sat down with John at Yahoo! last week to talk about Wikia&#8217;s choioce of YUI as its frontend library. Like many startups during the past few years, Wikia was faced with an intriguing decision about its frontend architecture, and it considered four of the major open-source libraries before settling on YUI. We wanted to know what factors drove their decision and what they thought we needed to do better with YUI to improve the experience of implementers. </p>
</div>
<p class="q"><strong>Tell us a little bit about Wikia. What point are you at in the evolution of your product and your company? What is its relationship to Wikipedia? </strong></p>
<p>We like to say that Wikia and Wikipedia have the same parents, but that otherwise we&#8217;re not related.  We share with Wikipedia a lot of the same fundamental ways we treat communities and we share with them an overarching respect  for the kinds of content generation done by communities. We run on the same software as Wikipedia, MediaWiki, but there&#8217;s no business relationship.</p>
<p>At Wikia, our core strengths are community building and helping passionate people find others like them with whom they can collaborate. We have 3,000 communities today. One of the more popular ones is <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Wookieepedia</a>, a community passionate about all things Star Wars. We have <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page">a popular Star Trek community called Memory Alpha </a> and <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">a wonderful community based around the Muppets</a>. The <a href="http://marveldatabase.com">Marvel Database</a> site is a great one, and the <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org">Uncyclopedia</a>, which is an unholy parody of Wikipedia, is enough to stop all productivity in the office for at least 30 minutes daily. We have communities based on Sci-Fi, technology, health, travel, and much more&#8230;it&#8217;s a broad cross-section. Our communities build out huge amounts of content and we try to help them get great exposure for their content, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://wikia.com/"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/wikia.gif" width="550" height="237" border="0" /></a></p>
<p class="q"><strong>You have adopted YUI as your frontend framework for the interface you&#8217;re building on top of MediaWiki. Tell us about that decision. </strong></p>
<p>Our decision set consisted of five key points:</p>
<ol>
<li>speed of development </li>
<li>quality of the codebase</li>
<li>documentation and examples </li>
<li>robustness/future-proofing </li>
<li>browser support  </li>
</ol>
<p>All of the toolkits we considered (YUI, Dojo, JQuery, Prototype) cover this decision set to some degree, and all of them allow you to generate impressive UIs with just a few lines of code. But our vision for the future required a platform that would enable us to build the robust features and widgets that we want to create ourselves. So we need a framework that we would feel comfortable building on. YUI is versatile, because there&#8217;s so much you can do on top of it. But it&#8217;s also more than that, because it has a catalogue of bundled widgets also&#8230;it gives you the best of both worlds. All of that, combined with the documentation and example code, was important for us given our distributed development team. Our assessment was that there were other libraries that could jump-start our development more quickly, but we felt they would leave us less free over time.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one specific example of why we chose YUI: A lot of our designs so far have a three-column layout. We started with a test of different libraries dragging items across the three columns. All of the libraries we tested had at least some problem doing that with the exception of YUI. That kind of proved to us that there were things we wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about with YUI that might be a concern if we made another choice.</p>
<p>We also talked to a lot of other companies around the valley about YUI, including <a href="/yuiblog/blog/2007/01/12/smugmug/">SmugMug</a>, and most of them had the same response: You&#8217;re going to need to write some code to get exactly what you want done, but YUI is a great platform to write code with. For our needs, YUI felt like the right long-term choice.</p>
<p class="q"><strong>Every adoption of a new technology comes with some pain. What have the pain points been in adopting and using YUI so far? </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;re deep enough into it to feel the pain so far. What I&#8217;ve heard from the developers is that there&#8217;s a lot to learn to make full use of the library. Whereas with Ruby on Rails you have this great integration with Prototype and Scriptaculous, and you can get some wonderful interactions built very quickly, YUI has involved a little more mastery on the front end of the process for us. I&#8217;m sure there will be more pain points as we go, but that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at today.</p>
<p class="q"><strong>What does your UI look like a year from now? What challenges are you trying to overcome? </strong></p>
<p>Making things more simple and intuitive. If you&#8217;ve edited Wikipedia, you know what I&#8217;m talking about: &quot;Thar be dragons&#8230;&quot; We&#8217;d like to make it a more intuitive process for the user, and a more fun experience. People are in online communities because they&#8217;re passionate about something. We want to make the expression of that passion fun rather than demanding.  We also want to provide more visibility into the presence of other users, more core stuff around making the editing experience  friendly, more information back to the users about what they&#8217;re doing and what people are doing with the content they generate. Plus, I think there&#8217;s a lot we can do in terms of letting our users mashup or combine different sources of information.</p>
<p>For us, it&#8217;s all about tapping peoples&#8217; passions and not getting in their way.</p>
<p class="q"><strong>You&#8217;re growing quickly in terms of traffic. Does that mean you&#8217;re ramping up in terms of staff as well?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. We&#8217;ve grown from about 8 employees around the world a year ago to more than 30 today. Now that we&#8217;ve decided on YUI, we&#8217;re seeking out great frontend engineers who are familiar with YUI and want to work with Jimmy and Angela as they change the world again with Wikia, just as they did with Wikipedia. </p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have a YUI implementation that would be of interest to the YUI community? </strong>If so, please <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/links/YUI_Implementations_001149002597/">share your link</a> and post a message to the community forum at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/">YDN-JavaScript</a>, or leave us a message in the comments section below. </em></p>

			<div class="interview">
<div class="intro">
<p><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/FredericWelterlinHeadShot.jpg" alt="Fred Welterlin" width="125" height="150" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5">As part of our ongoing effort to understand (and share with you) the real-world experiences of YUI implementers, we met a few weeks ago with a team from <a href="http://avenuea-razorfish.com/">Avenue A | Razorfish</a>, an agency that works with many Fortune 100 clients to build best-in-class applications for the web and for corporate intranets.  AA|RF has the unique agency perspective of working regularly with a wide range of technologies.  We sat down with AA|RF&#8217;s Fred Welterlin to learn more about his group&#8217;s experiences in doing frontend engineering in the agency world.</p>
<p>As senior presentation layer developer, graphical alchemist, and Web Standards advocate with AA|RF, Fred&#8217;s experience and areas of focus include designing, architecting, and programming client-side templates, providing project management and technical recommendations, and developing multimedia widgets. Fred has ten years experience working as a user interface designer and developer &mdash; responsible for conceptual and practical design development for a wide range of business and industry needs.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/aarf.jpg" alt="From left to right: David Lazzarini, Oliver Langan, Chris Nardi, John Kepler, Julia Debari, Fred Welterlin, Ryan Triggs, Vikas Sharma, Marie De Luna" width="550" height="374"></p>
<p class="q"><strong>How has the nature of your web-development work for clients changed over the past couple of years, with the move toward more richness and client-side complexity?</strong></p>
<p>One of AA|RF&#8217;s greatest strengths as an agency is in creating compelling user experiences. The advent of such client side technologies as AJAX, JavaScript libraries, Flex, etc. has given us the ability to further enhance our capabilities in delivering next-generation user interfaces. Since many of our clients have existing back-ends, the amount of &quot;richness&quot; we can deliver tends to rely on how well client-side technologies can be integrated. Thus, we are especially interested in easily integrated, flexible, platform agnostic front end technologies. </p>
<p>&#8220;Web standards&#8221; based coding practices have also become an important aspect our development cycle. As projects get touched by multiple developers, and as timelines and resources evolve, having well written, semantic code structures not only helps in terms of organizing complex functionalities effectively, but also ultimately benefits the user in terms of a streamlined, highly performant experience.</p>
<p class="q"><strong>Because you work with the technologies that your clients have already implemented, you end up touching a lot of different frontend tools &mdash; YUI, Dojo, Prototype, jQuery, etc.  What role are these tools typically playing in your projects for your clients?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest impact that a client-side JavaScript library can have for AA|RF is in rapid prototyping for client pitches, and speeding up the development process for existing projects. Often, the turn around time for client deliveries is really tight, and the projects themselves are complex enough that having a client side framework is critical &mdash; after all, no one wants to recreate the wheel. Since JavaScript libraries also take care of many browser quirks, they give us the freedom to concentrate on what is most valuable to our clients &mdash; building better and richer user experiences.
</p>
<p class="q"><strong>You&#8217;ve implemented YUI as part of some major projects &mdash; when a traveler books travel with Southwest Airlines, they&#8217;re likely to run into the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/">YUI Calendar Control</a> as a result of your work, for example.  What are some of the most significant customers with which you&#8217;ve used YUI, and what parts of YUI did you use on those projects?</strong></p>
<p>We used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/">AutoComplete Control</a> on searches for a major global financial services provider. </li>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/">Animation</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/">DOM</a>, and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">Connection Manager</a> Utilities were used to create modal dialogs, drop down menus, and AJAX interactions for the redesign of Intermec Corporation.</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/">Calendar Control</a> for Southwest Airlines and for an intranet application for a leading biotech firm.</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/">DOM Collection</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">Connection Manager</a> on several Yahoo! Projects, including Yahoo! Talent Show.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/aarf-intermec.gif" alt="The AA|RF redesign of the Intermec website using YUI." width="550" height="246" /></p>
<p class="q"><strong>If you were asked to give advice to someone who was considering adopting YUI at this point in time for RIA development, what would you tell her about YUI&#8217;s core strengths?</strong></p>
<p>Along with the excellent documentation, community support, and available list of commonly used controls, the design patterns and examples for implementing YUI is where this particular toolkit stands above competing libraries. I see YUI as having been originally created to accommodate design needs by Yahoo&#8217;s very own web properties, thus leveraging the knowledge of the entire company&#8217;s collective experience (from web performance specialists, to UX specialists, developers, and designers, etc). The resulting toolkit provides not only common interface widgets, but also useful CSS design patterns, graded browser support patterns, hosting services, even plug-in style components, like <a href="http://billwscott.com/carousel/">Bill Scott&#8217;s carousel</a>.</p>
<p class="q"><strong>What would you say are areas where YUI needs to continue growing and improving?</strong></p>
<p>I would like to see YUI continue to stay in touch with developer needs in the industry. For example, one of the aspects that make jQuery really successful is that it was written by someone who needed a concise, straight forward way to handle typical JavaScript tasks. YUI has a similar appeal, in that it is sympathetic to the JavaScript hacker type person who needs to do quick and easy implementations, while still providing a powerful framework to accommodate an enterprise-level implementation. Your challenge is to continue developing YUI so that it can meet the goals of both of these archetypes.
</p>
<p class="q"><strong>For an agency like AARF &mdash; and ignoring for the moment the Microsoft acquisition &mdash; how do your developers feel about the ever-broadening list of technologies in play, from DHTML to Flash to Apollo to Silverlight to JavaFX Script and beyond?  Is it a great time to be in this industry, or is the supply of divergent platforms beginning to make it even harder to provide flexible agency-style support?</strong></p>
<p>Although these technologies are &quot;seemingly&quot; similar, they all have their strengths and weaknesses. What Silverlight brings to the table is something completely different from what Apollo has to offer. We have always been about taking a &#8216;business needs first&#8217; approach as far as technology choices are concerned and continue to do so. All the newly emerging tools have essentially enabled us to conceive and deliver experiences that were not possible before.</p>
<p>In general, having an ever-broadening list of technologies to choose from is good for the web dev industry in the same way that having many auto makers competing with each other for better, more efficient automobiles is good for consumers. For AA|RF in particular, the long list of technologies to choose from is a double-edged sword because on the one hand, its great to have the flexibility to choose a framework that best meets a client&#8217;s needs, on the other hand, as most developers like to specialize, it becomes more difficult to manage resources and place expertise on the appropriate project at the right time.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are certain interface development paradigms that have emerged as &quot;standard&quot; on all these new platforms. In the interest of wooing as many developers as possible, technology tool vendors are sticking to those standards, thereby reducing the learning curve quite a bit. In any case, there has never been a more exciting time to be working on the client side.</p>
