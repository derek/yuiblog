Isaac Schlueter ([@izs](http://twitter.com/izs)) is developing the [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/) version of [AutoComplete](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/). In this [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) session, "[Solving Problems with YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=schlueter-yuiconf2009-yui3)," he shows you how he's working with the core YUI 3 toolkit to address the various challenges inherent in developing a complex widget.
