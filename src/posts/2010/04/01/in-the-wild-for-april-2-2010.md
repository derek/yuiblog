The big news in the YUI world this week is the release of YUI 3.1.0, bringing with it a host of improvements as well as true `use()`\-level parity between YUI 3 core code, YUI 3 Gallery code (which is to say, _your code_), and sandboxed YUI 2 content working seamlessly in a YUI 3 environment. My congratulations to all of the YUI engineers who brought this important release to fruition.

In the meantime, here are some of the other news items I've noticed in the world of YUI developement over the past few weeks:

-   **[YUI 3's "quiet Revolution", from @triptych](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2010/03/27/yui3-and-a-quiet-revolution/):** [Writes Andrew Wooldridge](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2010/03/27/yui3-and-a-quiet-revolution/), in reference to the [YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/): "With other libraries, you have to find and link to extensions yourself – manage updates, and never know if the developer of the plugin you are depending on will stick with their code. With YUI 3 you know the code is open source, you can fork it if you need to, and since it’s hosted by Yahoo you know that it’ll probably stick around for some time. Not only that, but you know have a built-in almost App Store system for creating extensions! Say you have some interesting javascript effect , or some novel way to do something via js. You simply make it a YUI component and everyone who uses YUI 3 can include your code with essentially a single word (like “gallery-somefreakingawesomecode”). They dont have to know who you are, you dont have to worry about hosting your code, and you get not only and instant audience, but with GitHub you get people who can help you make your code better."
-   **[MarkoutJS -- a Templating API Based on YUI 3 from @ericf](http://oddnut.com/markout/):** Eric Ferriauolo of OddNut Software in Boston has released [MarkoutJS](http://oddnut.com/markout/), a templating API for creating DOM elements.  MarkoutJS is built on [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/) and is [part of the YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/markout), so as of the 3.1.0 release you can use it directly from the `use()` statement by requesting the gallery-markout module.

-   **[YUI 3 Event Delegation Tutorial from @kickballcreativ](http://kickballcreative.com/yui/demos/event-delegation/):** Lauren Smith of Kickball Creative, author of the excellent [YUISand module](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/yuisand) in the [YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/), has posted [a tutorial on using YUI 3's intrinsic support for event delegation](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/kickball-event-delegation-20100326-113057.jpg) -- a powerful performance-enhancing strategy.

[Full docs for the project are up on Andrew's site](http://projects.sophomoredev.com/yui-gallery-effects/).

-   **[Matt Snider Writes About His Radial Menu Module in the YUI 3 Gallery](http://mattsnider.com/widget/yui-3-radial-menu-gallery-component/):** Writes Matt: "The [RadialMenu gallery component](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/radialmenu) is finished and available on GitHub at [http://github.com/mattsnider/yui3-gallery/downloads](http://github.com/mattsnider/yui3-gallery/downloads). The latest version of the RadialMenu improves on the previous two articles by having the RadialMenu and RadailMenuPanel objects extend [Overlay](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/overlay/). By using the overlay component, RadialMenu can leverage the knowledge and experience that went into developing overlay, and we remove the need to mask the page with an invisible div."
-   **[YUI 3-based Carousel Implementation on IPRD.org.uk](http://iprd.org.uk/):** The world of YUI 3 widgets has another entrant in the form of a new carousel component developed for [IPRD](http://iprd.org.uk/) website in the UK. The developer has begun the process of submitting the widget to the YUI 3 Gallery.

-   **[Todd Kloots's YUI 2 Menu on BowlingBall.com](http://www.bowlingball.com/):** If you'd asked me five years ago whether DHTML menus were intersting, I would have said -- "Um, not so much." But after watching Todd Kloots, now at Flickr, spend a couple of years perfecting the [YUI 2 Menu Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/), it always makes me happy to see his elegant menu system powering the navigation of sites across the web.  [Bowlingball.com](http://bowlingball.com) is a site that makes good use of Todd's work to drive its primary menu-nav system across the top of the page.
