We have three Hangouts scheduled for this week, so you have plenty of opportunities to come hang out with other YUI folks and see the community process in action! Here are the dates and times below.

-   Tonight (**Jan 15th, 8:00 PM PST**) we discuss the Date and Number formatting PR ([#362](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/362)) from [Ashik Samad](https://github.com/ashiksmd).
    
-   Thursday afternoon (**Jan 17th, 2:00 PM PST**) we have our weekly YUI Open RoundTable. See the topics list [here](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Roundtable-Topics), and add a new topic if you have something you'd like us to cover at that time.
    
-   Friday afternoon (**Jan 18th, 2:00 PM PST**) we discuss Luke Smith's PR on Data Binding, referenced [here](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/386).
    

You can see these and other YUI related events and timelines on our [Development Schedule](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule) wiki page. If you want to join a hangout, come to #yui on IRC shortly before for more information.
