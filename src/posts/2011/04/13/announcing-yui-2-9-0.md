The YUI team is thrilled to announce the release of YUI version 2.9.0. YUI 2.9.0 is the [last bug fix release on the YUI 2 code line](/yuiblog/2010/12/17/yui-2-9-0-release-update/) marking its transition into maintenance mode. Moving forward, expect to see releases consisting of only critical bug fixes or fixes for browser compatibility issues resulting from updates to browsers in the [GBS](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/). We're truly excited to better focus our attention on the upcoming 3.4.0 release of YUI.

To get an idea of the changes included in YUI 2.9.0, you can review the [ReadMe Digest](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui2/wiki/ReadMe/Rollup_2.9.0) which summarizes all of the additions made by component developers to their respective ReadMe files for this release. You can also view the [list of tickets fixed](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui2/report/37) in YUI 2.9.0 for a summary of bug fixes and enhancement requests completed in this release.

We'd like to remind everyone that as we begin the process of deprecating YUI 2.x, all released versions will continue to be hosted on Yahoo's CDN and the code base will continue to be [forkable on GitHub.com](https://github.com/yui/yui2/).
