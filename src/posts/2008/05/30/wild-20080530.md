On the heels of [Wednesday's YUI 2.5.2 release](/yuiblog/blog/2008/05/28/yui-252/), we wanted to take minute to share some of the YUI links and projects that have caught our eye in the past few weeks.

-   [![Read more about Dom.activate on Matt Snider's blog.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/sniderblog.png)](http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/domactivate-to-focus-on-form-elements/)**[Matt Snider](http://mattsnider.com/) (F2E lead at [Mint](http://mint.com/))** continues his long-term process of blogging about the work he's doing building on top of YUI with "[Dom.activate to Focus on Form Elements](http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/domactivate-to-focus-on-form-elements/)." Matt writes: "Each browser supports focus in a slightly different way and until recently most did not support the 'select' Function on an Input Element. In addition, you should never attempt to focus on a hidden or non-displayed Element, nor should you focus on an Input Element of type 'hidden'. Because of all this trickiness, it is rather handy to have one method that manages all this for you." Looking for more explorations of forms management with YUI? [Check out InputEx](/yuiblog/blog/2008/05/08/inputex/).
-   **New YUI-based accordion menu:** Simple By Design has a new [SBD Accordion Menu based on YUI](http://www.simplebydesign.co.uk/joomla/modules/sbd-accordion-menu.html). It's always great to see another variation on this evergreen interaction pattern (see also [Hedger Wang's accordion](http://www.hedgerwow.com/360/mwd/accordion/demo.php?page=1) from a few years back).
-   **[Calendar range selection tutorial](http://blogs.whardy.com/john/entry/interval_calendar_control):** John Peloquin has created a fantastic tutorial on [using the YUI Calendar Control for date-range selection](http://blogs.whardy.com/john/entry/interval_calendar_control). His example shows you how to implement this with single-month and mult-month displays. John's generously contributed the code to the YUI project, so we'll be adding this as a standard Calendar example in a future release.
-   **[Bold Lentil shows you how to get YUI working on the Google App Engine](http://boldlentil.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/yahoo-ui-on-app-engine/):** The Google App Engine, Google's new cloud-computing platform, is framework-agnostic on the JavaScript side, so if YUI is your framework of choice you'll be happy to see this quick tutorial from Bold Lentil that shows you how to get a [YUI-driven donut slider](http://1boldlentil.appspot.com/slider) (and, alas, [a feral pumpkin slider](http://1boldlentil.appspot.com/feral-pumpkin-slider)) going in the Google environment.
-   **Ongoing progress from Robert Schultz on _World of Solitaire_:** [Last August we told you about Robert Schultz](/yuiblog/blog/2007/08/20/schultz-solitaire/), who's created a fantastic, highly polished card-gaming platform at [worldofsolitaire.com](http://worldofsolitaire.com/). He's up to 41 games now and more than 750,000 registered users; and a few months ago, the one billionth move and 2 millionth winning hands were registered on the site. You can follow his progress on the [World of Solitaire blog](http://worldofsolitaire.blogspot.com/).

-   **More integration news — [YUI RTE with Backbase](http://bdn.backbase.com/client/examples/yuiwidgetsRichTextEditor):** With the proliferation of JavaScript frameworks, it's increasingly common to see projects based on one framework that go to a second or third framework to pull in unique features. We see that frequently in YUI with the [Rich Text Editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/editor/flickr_editor.html), which is a unique and highly specialized component. Backbase has published a new tutorial on "[Integrating YUI Widgets with Backbase](http://bdn.backbase.com/client/examples/yuiwidgetsRichTextEditor)", focusing on the RTE.
-   **YUI Compressor MSBuild task:** Nick Berardi at Coder Journal put together [a nice tutorial on using YUI compressor as part of his MSBuild workflow](http://www.coderjournal.com/2008/05/how-to-create-a-yui-compressor-msbuild-task/).
-   **[Johanna van Egmond's YUI-based UED design portfolio](http://tenhanna.com/futurarose/):** We'll leave you on a high note here with designer [Johanna van Egmond's personal portfolio site](http://tenhanna.com/futurarose/) (coded with YUI by Maarten van Egmond). Most sites of this kind are done with Flash, but what Johanna and Maarten have put together here is an extravagant testament to how good DHTML is as an environment for celebrating visual design.
