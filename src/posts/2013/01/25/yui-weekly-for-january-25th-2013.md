_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, leave a comment below._

-   This week saw two releases of YUI. [3.8.1 was released](/yuiblog/2013/01/23/yui-3-8-1-released/) as a 3.8 patch for iOS6 compatability improvements in addition to updates for DataTable, Attribute, and Template. The second release this week was [3.9.0pr2](/yuiblog/2013/01/25/yui-3-9-0pr2/), a follow-up preview release to last week's [3.9.0pr1](/yuiblog/2013/01/16/yui-3-9-0pr1-charts-jsonp-and-responsive-grids/). Jenny also [posted some details](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/eZgWdtE2wI4) about our release process policy on the mailing list. Happy upgrading!
    
-   A huge thanks and welcome to YUI's newest external contributor, Joey Smith, who offered to [take over management](/yuiblog/2013/01/24/yui-compressor-has-a-new-owner/) of the YUI Compressor project.
    
-   New to the [YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/yuilibrary) is Dmitry Savintsev and Albert Yu's [YUIConf 2012](http://lanyrd.com/2012/yuiconf/) talk "[Security Testing of YUI-Powered Applications](/yuiblog/2013/01/23/yuiconf-2012-dmitry-savintsev-and-albert-yu-on-security-testing-of-yui-powered-applications/)".
    
-   As you may have seen from his [Future of YUI CSS talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpyBAQt7hUs) at YUIConf, Jeff Conniff has been working on a Skin Builder app for YUI. While the project is not yet complete, you can checkout this [preview](http://jconniff.github.com/skinner/) in the meantime. Very cool!
    
-   Two Hangouts were held this week. First up was the weekly [Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssn2Jmr4qcc) which included discussions about the YUI release process, YUI Compressor ownership, and pull requests. Luke Smith also hosted a [follow-up Hangout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS-Fz3lgRoQ) for his [Data Binding, Take Two pull request](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/386).
