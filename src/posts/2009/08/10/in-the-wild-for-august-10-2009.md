News and notes from the YUI community over the past few weeks; let us know what we missed in the comments section.

-   **[YUI on Gatorade.com](http://playeroftheyear.gatorade.com/winners/2008-09/boys-baseball/downloads/):** Reader LNR [wrote in](/yuiblog/blog/2009/07/17/in-the-wild-for-july-17-2009/#comment-583107) to tell us about the [Gatorade.com Player of the Year site](http://playeroftheyear.gatorade.com/winners/2008-09/boys-baseball/downloads/), which is making extensive use of YUI.  "It uses the drag/drop library for custom scrollbars, the Container library for lightbox-style overlays, the Event library to fire several events on window resize, the Element library, and of course the Dom library."

-   **[Adding a Library Class to YUI 3](http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/yui-adding-a-library-class-to-yui-3/):** YUI contributor Matt Snider blogs about adding new modules to YUI 3.  "The upcoming release of YUI 3 is going to change the way we develop using the YUI framework. Instead of namespacing the library behind the `YAHOO` object, as was done in YUI 2, in YUI 3 the library will be referenced in isolated functional contexts by calling `YUI().use`. Thus developers need to modify their code to wrap everything that uses the YUI library with a `YUI().use` call."  His post goes through the `add` and `use` methods and how to `use` a module that you've `add`ed to YUI 3.

User Interface library (YUI)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) allows you to implement the server side in any technology. The server will render JSON text for a given request, and YUI parses the JSON response to create JavaScript variables for use in UI widgets."  [Check out the full article here](http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/42399).

-   **[Jim Driscoll, "Using the YUI Calendar Widget with JSF 2"](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/driscoll/archive/2009/08/using_the_yui_c_1.html):** [Writes Jim](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/driscoll/archive/2009/08/using_the_yui_c_1.html): "If you're not developing JSF with third party component libraries, you're really missing out on the best part of JSF. But there's lots of Ajax widgets out there, which contain all kinds of useful functionality. Wouldn't it be useful to use those within your JSF pages? The Yahoo UI library is pretty nifty stuff, and the [Calendar widget](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/) is useful, pretty, and powerful. Let's wire it into a JSF page, and bind the return of that widget to the property of a bean. How hard could it be? 71 lines, of which about 45 or so are non-boilerplate."  [Check out all 71 lines on his blog](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/driscoll/archive/2009/08/using_the_yui_c_1.html).
