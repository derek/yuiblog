The BayJax meetup for October will be held at Yahoo! once again and features another outstanding slate of speakers. Brad Neuberg from Google's Developer Program will be here to provide "An Introduction to HTML 5", and he'll touch on his [his most recent work on SVG](http://www.svgopen.org/2009/keynotes.shtml). David Storey and Andreas Bovens from Opera will be here to delver a talk entitled "10 Essential Things You Should Know about supporting Opera."

The event starts at 6 p.m. (pizza and beer) with the talks starting at 7 p.m. Attendance is free, but seating is limited — please sign up [on the BayJax Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/calendar/11432565/).
