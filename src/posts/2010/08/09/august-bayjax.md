Join us for the next event in Douglas's ongoing series of lectures on JavaScript. This talk, [part of the Bayjax meetup series](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/calendar/14371278/?from=list&offset=0 "Douglas Crockford: Loopage -  BayJax - The Bay Area Ajax and JavaScript Meetup (Palo Alto, CA) - Meetup.com"), is entitled "Loopage." Here's how Douglas describes the new talk:

> Software development is hampered by a specific set of design mistakes that were made in the first programming languages and repeated in everything that has been done since. And, somewhat miraculously, JavaScript is going to make it right, radically transforming the way we write applications. Again. In the Loop of History, it has all happened before, but it has never happened like this. This is why you should care about the emergence of server-side JavaScript and the excitement around projects like Node.js — not because they're at the sharp end of a trend, but because they're paving the road toward the next big revolution in software.

We to see you for a fantastic new episode of BayJax and an always-worth-the-price-of-admission Crockford lecture; after the talk, we hope you'll head over to [the Node.js Knockout hackathon](http://nodeknockout.com/) to enact all your fresh inspiration.
