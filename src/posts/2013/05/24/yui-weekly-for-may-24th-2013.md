_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   Today we reach the **Sprint 7 Feature Complete** milestone, which is just fancy terminology for the last day that new feature pull requests can be merged into the next release of YUI. The next milestone on the [current development cycle](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#wiki-next-release) is the **Commit Freeze Pull Request Deadline** next Tuesday PM. So if you have anything for inclusion into the **June 4th** release of YUI, you only have a few days left!
    
-   Yeti v0.2.23 was released this week to increases stability in IE and fix a few bugs. Check out the [release announcement](/yuiblog/2013/05/23/yeti-0-2-23-released/) for more details. Also, [Yogi](https://github.com/yui/yogi) saw a version bump this week ([diff](https://github.com/yui/yogi/compare/e7a61a2d99f8a90621ed5686cb67831f51bdb0d3...e42685966542e5abbd7b56c86c31e98bd4218541)) to lock in version dependencies. Upgrade with `npm install -g yeti yogi`.
