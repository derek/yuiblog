Google, of late, has been stepping up its public contributions to the world of frontend engineering: Gears, GWT, Doctype, and Google I/O are all manifestations of this assertive public disposition. And it's no surprise that some of this engagement with the discipline stems from the hiring last year of [Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com) cofounder [Dion Almaer](http://almaer.com/blog/). You see Dion's leadership in events like I/O, but you also see his philosophy in steps like Google's hosting of major JavaScript libraries on Google's CDN...not just Google's library, but [a cross-section of commonly used kits are freely hosted](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/). (**Note:** YUI is not on this list yet, but Dion tells us it will be soon; in the meantime, [YUI is freely hosted on Yahoo's CDN](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/).)

Dion joined us at Yahoo a few weeks ago for us for a special F2E-focused tech talk about what he and his colleagues are excited about these days — from front (Gears) to back (Google App Engine). As you'd expect from Google, these are smart teams taking on challenging problems and delivering in a big way.

Dion was kind enough to let us shoot video of his talk and share it here; thanks to Ricky Montalvo for handling the [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) videography.
