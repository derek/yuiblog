### Featured Speakers

-   **[Nicholas C. Zakas](http://nczonline.net), "Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture":** Choosing a JavaScript library is only the first step in the process of creating a large, scalable web application front-end. Building an application framework on top of a JavaScript library empowers your development team, makes your code more maintainable, and allows surgical updates to existing code without risking overall application stability. You’ll learn all you need to know to start building your own JavaScript application framework using real-world examples as a guide for design decisions.
