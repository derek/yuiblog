This Friday, April 9th, the YUI team will be initiating a new outreach project, called Open Hours. This is how it's going to work:

At a regular time and day (which will solidify eventually), I and/or another YUIer will open a conference call and start an Adobe Connect screen sharing session. **Anybody that wants to join the call is welcome to join**. We'll have a primary topic each time, but otherwise it will be a free forum for discussion. We'll do code reviews of Gallery modules or other new and interesting code. We'll talk architecture and best practices, do deep dives on new features in the latest YUI release, talk about new and upcoming hotness in YUI land, and generally plot world domination.

The first Open Hours will be this Friday from 10am to 12pm PDT. The primary topic will be an introduction to and code review of Lauren Smith's [YUISand Gallery module](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/yuisand). Here's how to participate:

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (non-US participants, [email me](mailto:lsmith@yahoo-inc.com) for a local number)
2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

### Ongoing schedule

The idea is to hold Open Hours weekly or bi-weekly. We'll try to be flexible and evolve Open Hours as we discover with everyone else what the best format, day and time, and structure is. We'll keep the [YUI Event Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/calendar/#calendar) updated with upcoming Open Hours and their topics, and we'll post reminders and other important information here as well. If this is the kind of event that interests you, [following @yuilibrary on Twitter](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) is also a good way to get updates on upcoming sessions.

This is a great opportunity for developers to directly connect with not only the YUI team, but also with other YUI users and contributors, ask questions, give feedback and share and develop ideas with and for YUI.

I know it's short notice, but come one, come all, if even for a few minutes. We expect it will be a pretty small gathering with a lot of opporutinities for participation -- we'd love to see you there.
