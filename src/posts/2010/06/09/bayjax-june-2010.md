[Head over to the Meetup page to RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/calendar/13740808/).

### Accessibility on the Yahoo! Homepage by Nicholas Zakas and Victor Tsaran

Accessibility isn't hard and, contrary to popular belief, it doesn't take a lot of extra effort. Learn how the Yahoo! homepage team built accessibility into the product development cycle with the goal of providing the best possible user experience to everyone. Using a combination of progressive enhancement, ARIA, and a little ingenuity, even the most complex and dynamic features on the new Yahoo! homepage are available to everyone in interesting and fun ways.

### The Five Layers of Web Accessibility by Dirk Ginader

Dirk Ginader, part of the Yahoo! Accessibility Taskforce, will talk about the "5 Layers of Web Accessibility." He extends the traditional three-layer web development model (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) with two new layers for accessibility. He shows how easy it can be to make a website or web application more accessible by following a set of simple rules.
