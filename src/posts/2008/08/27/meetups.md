[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/meetups.png)](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1036555)Earlier this month, we released a preview of [the next generation of YUI — YUI 3.x](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/). We've already gotten a lot of valuable feedback from members of the [YUI 3.x community forum](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/yui3/); thanks to everyone who's downloaded the preview and started evaluating the new APIs.

Next week, we'd like to invite you over for beer and snacks here at Yahoo! to meet with YUI's developers and talk about the goals and strategies intrinsic to the project. The setting will be small and informal — no slides, just some code demos and some discussion about the project. If you can make it, we'll also be looking to hear from you about how this new version of the library meets (or fails to meet) your current and emerging needs.

To make it as convenient as possible for Bay Area folks, we're doing two meetups:

-   **[Sunnyvale:](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1036555/)** [Wednesday, September 3, 7 p.m.](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1036555/) — Yahoo! Headquarters, Building E
-   **[San Francisco:](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1036556/)** [Thursday, September 4, 7 p.m.](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1036556/) — Yahoo! Brickhouse

Follow the links above to Upcoming to reserve a spot and get directions if you'd like to join us. We plan to broadcast the Sunnyvale event on live.yahoo.com; details to follow here on the blog when we get closer to the event.

Hope to see you here at Yahoo next week.
