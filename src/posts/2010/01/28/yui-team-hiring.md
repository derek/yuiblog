If working alongside people like [Douglas Crockford](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-yuiconf2009-state "Video: Douglas Crockford — The State and Future of JavaScript (YUI Theater)") and on the team that created [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ "YUI Library") ([Matt Sweeney](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=sweeney-yuiconf2009-performance "Video: Matt Sweeney — YUI 3 Performance (YUI Theater)"), [Adam Moore](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/yui/ "YUI 3: YUI Global Object"), [Dav Glass](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=glass-yuiconf2009-contributing "Video: Dav Glass — Contributing to YUI (YUI Theater)"), [Jenny Donnelly](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/4693580/12542476 "Jenny Donnelly: "), [Luke Smith](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=smith-yuiconf2009-events "Video: Luke Smith — Events Evolved (YUI Theater)"), Tripp Bridges, [Allen Rabinovich](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=rabinovich-yuiconf2009-charts "Video: Allen Rabinovich — YUI 3 Infographics (YUI Theater)"), [Alaric Cole](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Learning-Flex-3/Alaric-Cole/e/9780596517328/ "Learning Flex 3, Adobe Developer Library Series, Alaric Cole, Book - Barnes & Noble"), [Satyen Desai](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets "Video: Satyen Desai — A Widget Walkthrough (YUI Theater)"), and others) sounds like a good way to spend your time, read on: We're hiring.

We're looking for a great engineer to help us improve every aspect of our continuous integration (CI) process, including the way we build, document, test, and deploy our code. To succeed in this role, you'll have to be:

-   familiar with best practices in frontend engineering (e.g., [this video](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/4671445/12486762 "Nate Koechley: ") should make good sense to you);
-   knowledgeable about the goals and principles of continuous integration;
-   interested in the emerging discipline of automated testing for frontend code (e.g. [this video](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/3737228/10267335 "Nicholas C. Zakas: ") and [the first half of this one](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=resig-testing "Video: John Resig — Testing, Performance Analysis, and jQuery 1.4 (YUI Theater)") should make sense to you, and projects like [TestSwarm](http://testswarm.com) should be deeply interesting);
-   able to solve diverse problems with a heterogeneous set of technologies (e.g. DHTML/Python/Java/Ant/linux/PHP/JavaScript);
-   excited about creating a state-of-the art CI process for YUI and evangelizing it throughout Yahoo! and beyond.

YUI is an open source project, and many of the pieces you'll be working with are part of the YUI ecosystem. That begins with our [YUI Builder tools](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/builder) and extends to components of our existing CI process — tools like [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ "YUI Compressor"), [YUI Doc](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/ "YUI Doc") and [YUI Test](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/ "YUI 2: YUI Test"). You'll have the opportunity to improve the tools themselves and to improve the way they're documented and used.

The best part of any job in technology is having the chance to do influential work in an environment that both challenges and supports your growth. The YUI team provides just that confluence of characteristics: a huge, engaged community of users and developers and a team of brilliant engineers collaborating every day to improve the project.

If this sounds like your dream job, and if the people I mentioned above sound like people you'd want to work with every day, I'd love to hear from you.
