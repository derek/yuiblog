If you can't make it to the [YUI meetup tonight](/yuiblog/blog/2008/08/27/meetups/) but you do want to drop in and see what's going on, we'll be broadcasting the event on the experimental [Yahoo! Live](http://live.yahoo.com/miraglia) service:

-   [http://live.yahoo.com/miraglia](http://live.yahoo.com/miraglia)

Live is a relatively recent product out of Yahoo's Brickhouse development incubator. We haven't used it for this purpose before, but since we'll be up at Brickhouse for [tomorrow night's meetup](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1036556/) we thought we'd highlight some of that group's fantastic work.

Hope to see you online or in person tonight!

_**Note:** The Live channel will not be broadcasting all day — just from about 7:15 p.m. through the end of the code demos. Drop in after 7:15 p.m. PDT tonight and, barring any technical challenges, you should find us there._
