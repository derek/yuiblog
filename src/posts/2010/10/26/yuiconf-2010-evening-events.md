[YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/) is sold out! Thanks to everyone who registered — we look forward to seeing all of you in November. We're now putting the final touches on our schedule, but you can take a peek at what we have in store here: [http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/schedule.php](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/schedule.php).

Highlights include:

-   A Node.js track where you can ramp on all the exciting things happening with server-side JavaScript. We have Node.js creator Ryan Dahl presenting and sitting on a panel about the future of frontend engineering, and we have YUI's Dav Glass, one of the first to demonstrate Node-based progressive enhancement using off-the-shelf library components (from YUI 3), showing what the future looks like.
-   A YQL track to get you up to speed on how to leverage YQL to access data from anywhere on the Internet. The YQL team itself will be on hand to tell you about their latest work.
-   Case studies that expose how real-world projects implement YUI in demanding production environments. Engineers from Flickr and Yahoo! Mail will be on hand, and Eric Ferraiuolo -- winner of a PayPalX prize for his recent work -- will be here to talk about [Tip the Web](http://tiptheweb.org), his latest YUI 3-based project.
-   Insightful presentations on how to deliver mobile/touch experiences.
-   Deep dives on YUI modules, from AutoComplete to CSS Grids to Gallery contributions.

All sessions will be archived to video and available on [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) shortly after the conference.

We're excited to join forces with the Yahoo! Developer Network to host two special evening events that will be open to the general public. So although the conference is already sold out, anyone can attend the evening events by signing up at Meetup.com. Space is limited, so sign up soon! (YUIConf attendees do not need to sign up.)
