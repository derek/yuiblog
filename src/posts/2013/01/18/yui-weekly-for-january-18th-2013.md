_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, leave a comment below._

-   This week saw the release of **3.9.0 Preview Release 1**, which focused on Charts, JSONP, Responsive Grids, iOS6, and more. You can read all the details in the [3.9.0pr1 blog post](/yuiblog/blog/2013/01/16/yui-3-9-0pr1-charts-jsonp-and-responsive-grids/) and we are [scheduled](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#wiki-next-release) for **3.9.0 GA** on **January 22nd**. Happy testing!

-   Yesterday we flipped the switch and enabled Github's [Issues](https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues?state=open) as an alternative bug tracker. See the [blog post](/yuiblog/blog/2013/01/17/announcing-support-for-github-issues-in-yui/) for more details on this decision. We'd love to hear ongoing feedback, so let us know what you think by leaving a comment on that post.
