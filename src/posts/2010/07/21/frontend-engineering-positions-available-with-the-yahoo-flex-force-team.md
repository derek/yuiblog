The Yahoo! Flex Force is currently looking to expand our team with a few talented frontend Engineers. As part of the Flex Force team, you will have the opportunity to work on multiple strategic projects of high profile and high visibility. These positions involve being an ambassador of best practices and sharing knowledge across the organization. We work closely with the different platform teams, including the YUI team, to ensure we're using the latest strategies, techniques, and tools.

As a recent example, the Flex Force team was behind the implementation of the new [Yahoo! Updates widget](http://www.yahoo.com/add?url=http://profiles.yahoo.com/updates/ "Add Yahoo! Updates widget to your home page") which is built entirely using [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/ "YUI 3 — Yahoo! User Interface Library").

To be successful at this role, you'll need to be a self-starter and fast learner with a positive mindset who can quickly ramp up and take on different challenges. A true passion for frontend technologies and best practices is also required.
