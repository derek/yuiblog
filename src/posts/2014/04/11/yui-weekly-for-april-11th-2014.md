## Release News

We released **YUI 3.16.0** this week! Big props to everyone on the core team and the community!

## YUI Open Roundtable

In this week's [YUI Open Roundtable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO6hbFIgQlg), [Juan Dopazo](https://twitter.com/juandopazo) from the YUI Team sat down with [Andrew](twitter.com/triptych) to talk about Promises and ES6 Modules in YUI. Juan stepped through what Promises are and how you can use them today. It was a great discussion that I highly recommend checking it out if you're new to Promises.

[Towards the end of the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO6hbFIgQlg&feature=share&t=58m44s), Juan also talked about how you can write YUI modules in ES6 by leveraging the new `YUI.require()` method, `imports`/`exports`, and transpiling code via the [Square ES6 Transpiler](https://github.com/square/es6-module-transpiler).

## The World of JavaScript

-   If you follow Node.js news, you probably know that [Express 4.0 was released](http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html) this week! So are you going to upgrade to Express 4.0 or use [Koa](http://koajs.com/)?
    
-   Lauren Orsini has a nice tutorial up on how to leverage the newly open-sourced [WinJS API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dn632015) to [build a Windows app in 10 easy steps](http://readwrite.com/2014/04/04/winjs-how-to-build-app-html5-10-steps) using HTML technologies.
    
-   Most sites on the web use Google Analytics, and David Walsh has a short post up on how you can [use GA to track JavaScript errors](http://davidwalsh.name/track-errors-google-analytics).
    

This was an exciting week for the team, with the release of 3.16.0 and a great Open Roundtable discussion! Remember that next Friday is Good Friday, so there will not be a YUI Weekly next week. I'll see you guys back here on April 25th!
