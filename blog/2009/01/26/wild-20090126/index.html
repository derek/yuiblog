It was a lot of fun. In particular, we wanted to unify the web service APIs that we already publish with this AJAX work, so that it would be easy to write web browser code that could talk to the exact same API’s we publish for developers who are integrating with Launchpad. That’s now possible, which means that any API we use for AJAX work will also be available to developers writing their own tools to access Launchpad directly through the web services. Thanks to the awesomeness of YUI 3, the team is now hard at work turning those ideas into reality."&nbsp; We're thrilled to have this savvy team building on YUI 3 and we're looking forward to the great feedback that will result from that process.<li id="yuiBlogWild-152"><a href="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/progressbar/"><img align="right" hspace="10" src="/blog-archive/assets/Progress_Bar-20090110-101747.jpg" vspace="5" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/progressbar/">Satyam's Progress Bar Widget Updated for 3.0.0PR2 (and 2.6.0)</a>:</strong> <a href="http://www.satyam.com.ar/">Satyam</a>'s excellent <a href="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/progressbar/">Progress Bar widget has been updated for 3.0.0PR2</a> (and there is a <a href="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.5.0/progressbar/">2.x version as well</a>).&nbsp; He's added <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/">YUI Doc</a>-generated documentation and there are numerous styles to choose from.&nbsp; Because this is Satyam, you would expect there to be impeccable documentation, and <a href="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/progressbar/">you won't be disappointed</a>.<li id="yuiBlogWild-165"><a href="http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/davidcilley/archive/2009/01/21/converting-yui-buttongroups-into-image-buttons.aspx"><img align="right" hspace="10" src="/blog-archive/assets/cilleyimagebuttongroup-20090122-152311.jpg" vspace="5" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/davidcilley/archive/2009/01/21/converting-yui-buttongroups-into-image-buttons.aspx">David Cilley on Converting YUI ButtonGroups into Image Buttons</a>:</strong> <a href="http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/davidcilley/archive/2009/01/21/converting-yui-buttongroups-into-image-buttons.aspx">Writes David</a>: "ButtonGroups in YUI are fairly quick to implement, have a nice look, and act the way most people expect.&nbsp; I’ve been surprised to find out that there are no options available to use images in place of the text on the Buttons inside the ButtonGroup.&nbsp; In our most recent AJAX Photo Viewer Demo, I decided to use a ButtonGroup for the main mouse tool controls, and Bill Bither suggested that I use icons instead of text. I didn’t want to throw away what I’d done so far, since the demo was pretty much done at that point.&nbsp; I poked around YUI’s documentation a bit and came up with simple function that can convert a YUI Button into an image only button, much like a button on a tool bar.&nbsp; These converted <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/button/">YUI Buttons</a> still maintain the same original properties internally, so you can use them interchangeably."&nbsp; As usual, David provides full code source in his <a href="http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/davidcilley/archive/2009/01/21/converting-yui-buttongroups-into-image-buttons.aspx">post</a>, along with a live conversion demo.<li id="yuiBlogWild-168"><strong><a href="http://blog.davglass.com/2009/01/browser-sniffing-vs-object-detection/">YUI Engineer Dav Glass on Browser-sniffing Vs. Feature Detection</a>:</strong> Dav provides a look inside the thought process of one of YUI's most pivotal and prolific engineers: "<span style="line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse;">While developing the&nbsp;<a></a><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);" target="_blank">YUI Rich Text Editor</a>&nbsp;I learned that browser sniffing is, indeed, quite needed. Now, YUI does browser sniffing a little different. We try to detect the different rendering engines, so there is no firefox, mozilla, safari or chrome. It’s gecko, webkit, ie, etc.. The main reason that sniffing is needed in the Editor is because of the&nbsp;<strong>execCommand</strong>&nbsp;method. All of the A-Grade browsers support the method. The method is there to detect, but they all don’t do the same thing when executed. So how am I to tell what I am supposed to do? I have to rely on sniffing in order to make the browsers behave the way I want them to." &nbsp;You can <a href="http://blog.davglass.com/2009/01/browser-sniffing-vs-object-detection/">read the full entry on Dav's blog</a>.</span><li id="yuiBlogWild-150"><strong><a href="http://www.dailymile.com/">YUI Sightings — YUI Carousel on DailyMile.com</a>:</strong> Ben Weiner wrote emailed to let us know that he'd deployed Gopal Venkatesan's <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/carousel/">YUI Carousel Control</a> on <a href="http://www.dailymile.com/">DailyMile.com</a> to good effect.&nbsp; You can see the custom-styled Carousel implementations both on the <a href="http://www.dailymile.com/">homepage</a> and on the <a href="http://www.dailymile.com/forums">forums page</a>.<br /><a href="http://www.dailymile.com/"><img src="/blog-archive/assets/dailymile-20090109-175109.jpg" vspace="10" /></a><li id="yuiBlogWild-155"><strong><a href="http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/YUI-Timeline">YUI Timeline on Xtimeline.com</a>:</strong> User kejun has put up a timeline of all YUI releases since 2006 up on xtimeline.com — a nice visualization of how far the library has come and a reminder of all the steps along the way.

Zakas on 'the YUI 3 Revolution'</a>:</strong> Nicholas is part of the extended YUI family, so we're not reaching far afield for this, but it's worth sharing his thoughts on YUI 3 -- after all, he <a href="/blog-archive/blog/2008/11/11/frontpage-and-yui3%20/">led the team that built the next-generation Yahoo home page around our early YUI 3 versions</a>. &nbsp; Writes Nicholas: "I’ve heard some people complain that YUI 3 is too different from YUI 2, and that making such a different library is a mistake. I actually believe that this was exactly the right move at exactly the right time and give the YUI team a lot of credit for having the guts to do it. In a world where evolutionary programming is the preferred approach, YUI decided for a revolutionary approach."

But this flexibility comes at a price: we do not know which apps are on a page when it gets loaded; further, we want to be able to add new portlets to each page at any time. From a Javascript perspective, this means that traditional 'just put script tags into the header'-style Javascript coding will lead to a very bad user experience, since every page would be bloated with stuff the user will never use and - even more important- the user experience will degrade as we are adding new features to our product, even if our customer does not need or want the new features."&nbsp; <a href="http://www.agimatec.de/blog/2009/01/using-yui-to-load-your-javascript-modules/">Check out their post</a> for full details and sample code.<li id="yuiBlogWild-164"><a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/01/accessible_converter.html"><img align="right" hspace="10" src="/blog-archive/assets/currencycenter-20090122-094848.jpg" vspace="5" /></a><strong><a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/01/accessible_converter.html">The New, More Accessible Yahoo Currency Converter</a>:</strong> Dirk Ginader <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/01/accessible_converter.html">writes on the YDN Blog</a> about his team's work making the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter">Yahoo!
