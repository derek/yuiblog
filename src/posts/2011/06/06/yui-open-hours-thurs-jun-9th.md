### YUI 3 App Framework (think MVC)

Version 3.4.0 will see the release of a new, very important infrastructure piece to the YUI suite of application and widget scaffolding: [Ryan Grove](http://twitter.com/yaypie) has teamed up with [Eric Ferraiuolo](http://twitter.com/ericf) to create what we're calling the App Framework. Where the existing `Base`, `Widget`, and `Plugin` classes are great foundational pieces for atomic sets of functionality, the app framework adds `Model`, `ModelList`, `View`, and `Controller` classes to help you assemble and manage your data models, UI logic, and associated functionality. Like the component infrastructure pieces, the app framework aims to encapsulate some common patterns that can speed up your development process and help you create something stable and scalable.

Join the call for a tour of what's already built and what's in the works for the next 3.4.0 Preview Release, and to give us your feedback.
