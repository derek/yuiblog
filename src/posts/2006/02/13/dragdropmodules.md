**Problem Summary**

The user needs needs to re-arrange the layout of modules on a web page directly with the mouse.

[![Re-arranging modules with drag and drop on My Yahoo!](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/images/sub_dragdropmod.gif)](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_dragdropmodules.php)

Drag and drop has been a common feature on desktop applications for many years. It is only recently that it has found its way to the web. There are a host of [new web sites that attempt to bring the desktop to the web](http://ajaxian.com/by/topic/portal/). These webtops usually implement drag and drop in order to re-arrange modules around the "desktop" within a browser page.

Recently, we added drag and drop support to [My Yahoo!](http://my.yahoo.com). We spent a good deal of time doing user research and refining our [drag and drop library](http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/dragdrop/index.html) in the process. The result of that research and experimentation has been documented in this pattern.

The pattern can be found at: [Drag and Drop Modules](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_dragdropmodules.php).
