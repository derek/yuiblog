[![Yahoo engineer Ron Adams at YUICONF 2009, held at the Yahoo! HQ in Sunnyvale; October 28, 2009.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/adams-yuiconf2009-testing-20091102-083944.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=adams-yuiconf2009-testing)

Ron Adams is a Yahoo! engineer in Southern California who has worked on a variety of Yahoo!'s media products including [OMG](http://omg.yahoo.com) and who now works for [Yahoo! Sports](http://sports.yahoo.com). Ron has been working with colleagues in QA to automate the exercise of JavaScript unit tests, and his [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009) session was entitled "[Automated Integration Testing with YUI Test, Selenium and Hudson](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=adams-yuiconf2009-testing)." As the title suggests, he outlines the process he's developed using [YUI Test](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/) for JavaScript unit tests, [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org/) as a CI/build tool for tracking and monitoring results, and [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) as the tool to exercise the JS unit tests in the browser.
