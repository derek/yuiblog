[![](http://l.yimg.com/a/i/ydn/features/openhack2008-2.png)](http://hackday.org)As some of you may recall, Yahoo held a big Open Hack Day back in September, 2006, at which many entertaining things happened, including [Beck playing a concert for assembled hackers on the Yahoo lawn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/256158576/). It's been too long, but we're doing it again on September 12 and 13. And, of course, [you're invited](http://hackday.org/).

The focus of Open Hack is to get together with other hackers and build cool stuff, show off the fruits of your labor, and win fun and fabulous prizes. But the Friday developer-day sessions also provide a chance for us to share with you work we've been doing at Yahoo that may be of use in your own projects and hacks. Although we haven't announced the full Friday schedule yet, I do want to let you know that there will be at least two YUI-focused sessions:

-   **September 12, 3 p.m.:** Matt Sweeney and I will be presenting an overview of the new YUI 3.x codeline. This will provide a good orientation to 3.x and insights about the transition from 2.x implementations to 3.x implementations.
-   **September 12, 5 p.m.:** Matt, Adam Moore and Satyen Desai will be giving a hands-on workshop building on YUI 3.0. Bring your laptop and be ready to write some code.

Other developer-day content that might be of particular interest to YUIBlog readers:

-   **September 12, 11 a.m.:** Flickr frontend engineer [Ross Harmes](http://techfoolery.com/) on hacking with Flickr data sources.
-   **September 12, 11 a.m.:** [ASTRA library](http://developer.yahoo.com/flash/) engineer Allen Rabinovich on using Flash in your hacks.
-   **September 12, 2 p.m.:** Rasmus Lerdorf on using Yahoo APIs in PHP.
-   **September 12, 4 p.m.:** [Douglas Crockford](http://crockford.com/) talking about JavaScript.

All times are provisional at this point, but reserve your spot on [HackDay.org](http://hackday.org/), check out the teaser below, and we'll look forward to seeing you here at Yahoo in a few weeks.
