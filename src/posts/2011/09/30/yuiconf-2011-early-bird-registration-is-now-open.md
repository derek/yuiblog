[Early-bird registration for YUIConf 2011 is now open on Eventbrite!]( 
http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2264234386
) This year's event will be held November 2-4 on Yahoo!'s Great America campus. We're excited to bring you a full day of hands-on training workshops (Wed) followed by two full days of tech talks about YUI (Thu/Fri). Registration for the conference costs $75 this year, with an early-bird rate of $50. Registration for the workshops will be separate from the conference and details are coming soon.

We are busy lining up great topics, including:

-   YUI component deep dives, including Dial and Calendar
-   YUI in mobile environments
-   Testing with YUI
-   Real-world migration stories
-   and much, much more!

As always, conference sessions will be video-taped and available on [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/) and our [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/yuilibrary) for all to enjoy.

Hope to see you there!
