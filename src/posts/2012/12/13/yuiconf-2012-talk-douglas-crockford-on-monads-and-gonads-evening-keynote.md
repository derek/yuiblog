Our [series](/yuiblog/2012/12/10/yuiconf-2012-talk-writing-for-developers-some-rational-techniques-by-evan-goer/) progresses through the talks from [YUIConf 2012](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf) and takes us to the next one from [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/). This was a lively evening keynote after the dinner at the conference. As always, keep up on the latest videos on [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/yuilibrary).

In this evening keynote from YUIConf 2012, the legendary JavaScript architect Douglas Crockford discusses one of the most elusive of all programming concepts: the monad. With this talk, Crockford attempts to break the long-standing Monad tutorial curse by explaining the concept and applications of monads in a way that is actually understandable to the audience.
