_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community._

## Release News

Work has started on [Sprint 12](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule), which will culminate in a YUI Release on February 25th. That's only three short weeks away!

## Open Roundtable

In this week's [Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXcbJ-U_WDU), Alberto and Clarence introduced us to Modown. We talked about design goals, how to incorporate [Modown](https://npmjs.org/search?q=modown) into a project, and discussed a few of the components in greater detail. If you're interested in NodeJS and build Express applications, you should check out [the video on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXcbJ-U_WDU). Modown consists of components that are useful in small and large apps.

## YUI in the news

Our CI guru, [Reid Burke](https://twitter.com/reid) wrote a comprehensive post over at [Yahoo's Engineering Tumblr](http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/75054690857/code-coverage-for-executable-node-js-scripts) this week. He discussed the issues around gathering code coverage metrics for executable scripts in NodeJS. To address this problem, he released an npm package called [`mock-utf8-stream`](https://github.com/reid/mock-utf8-stream), which makes it easy to run tests on streams. All in a week's work!

## YUIConf Videos

The following YUIConf were released this week:

-   [Introducing the ‘Modown’ Project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1ADXKyvHU0) by Caridy Patiño
-   [YUI + Closure Templates = Enterprise JSP Tags](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOems0HhpUA) by Manuel Jasso and Nathan Comstock
-   Julien Lecomte on [Mojito and Yahoo Search](/yuiblog/2014/01/31/yuiconf-2013-talk-julien-lecomte-on-mojito-and-yahoo-search/)

[Caridy](http://twitter.com/caridy) also has slides for his talk available [on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/caridy/yuiconfintroducing-modown-project)

## The World of JavaScript

-   Check out [promisejs.org](http://www.promisejs.org/), a site that introduces the concept of Promises in JavaScript and provides helpful resources for people learning about them.
-   [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/) is an easy to use Node.js based End-to-End (E2E) testing solution for browser based apps and websites. It received a lot of upvotes on Hacker News this week.
-   We use [Trello](https://trello.com) pretty heavily within the YUI Team, so I was surprised to find that Trello has quite a comprehensive [REST API](https://trello.com/docs/). Something to play around with!

That's all for this week. Until next week, folks!
