-   [YUIConf 2012](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/2012) is just **19 days away**! The speakers and sessions have been [announced](/yuiblog/blog/2012/10/26/yuiconf-2012-technical-sessions-and-a-survey/), and you can help us finalize the schedule by voting for your favorite topics in [this survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/BQ8RMPL). Registration is still open, but act fast because [early-bird registration](/yuiblog/blog/2012/10/05/yuiconf-2012-early-bird-registration-open/) is only available for a few more days!
    
-   With [YUI 3.7.3 out the door](/yuiblog/blog/2012/10/17/yui-3-7-3-windows-8-apps-and-ie-10/), we now turn our focus towards benchmarking and improving [performance](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Performance). The [next scheduled release](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule) is a preview release for 3.8 on **November 13th**, but we may also see early an preview release, as well as possible 3.7 patch releases. You can stay on top of everything going into 3.8 by following the 3.x [branch](https://github.com/yui/yui3/tree/3.x) and its [commits](https://github.com/yui/yui3/commits/3.x).
    
-   Next Tuesday (Oct 30th) the YUI Team is holding a Hangout to discuss [YUI and Windows 8](/yuiblog/blog/2012/10/23/yui-hangout-yui-and-windows-8/). This will be live-streamed via YouTube and available afterwards on the [YUI Theater](http://www.youtube.com/user/yuilibrary), but if you wish to actively participate, you can [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE1WMThQRzc3eUtCOGNybDEwTWlwcmc6MQ).
