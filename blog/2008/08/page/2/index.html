			<p>The web is made of open standards. This was a significant factor in the web&#8217;s displacement of proprietary application platforms. Openness is hugely attractive, so much so that the web dominates over competitors with better technologies. The difficult tradeoff that comes with a standards-based approach is that it is difficult to innovate. As a result, the basic technologies of the browser have been stalled for a decade. What innovation we&#8217;ve enjoyed, such as the Ajax revolution, has come by mining all of the latent, accidental potential of the existing standards. That potential has been used up.</p>

<p>If we are to go forward, we must repair the standards. This is something that must be done with great care. A revision to a standard is an act of violence, just like any surgical procedure. It should only be undertaken when the likely benefit far exceeds the cost and the pain and the risk. The web is particularly troublesome because it did not anticipate the management of software updates, which is why IE5, an ancient browser, still has more users than Safari and Opera combined. Changes to the standard can put developers in a very difficult position because the benefits to users of some browsers become the seeds of failure for the users of others. Developers must manage this gulf, and it is not easy. Developers are not well served by new standards that make their jobs even harder.</p>

<p>I think it is instructive to look at two approaches to managing innovation within a standards based system, one that I view as a success, and the other not so much. JavaScript was a promising but half-baked language that was irresponsibly rushed to market and then irresponsibly cast into a standard. That standard is called ECMAScript to avoid a trademark dispute. That standard was last revised in 1999.</p>

<p>It is clear that the language needs to be updated, but TC39 (the committee that is responsible for drafting a new standard) could not reach consensus on how to do it, so it split into two groups, each producing its own proposal. This was a good thing in that competition is healthy, and I believe that competition inspired improvements to both proposals. This was also a bad thing because no standards organization can adopt two proposal for the same standard. Without consensus, both proposals must fail.</p>

<p>On one side there was the proposal called ES4. It was unfortunate that it adopted that name because it strongly suggested that it was destined to be the Fourth Edition of ECMAScript, a fate that was not certain. The project was very open to new ideas and features, adopting a porkbarrel attitude that was almost Congressional in its expansiveness. Lots of good ideas were included without an adequate analysis of the language as a whole system. As a result, many overlapping features were adopted which would have significantly increased the complexity of the language.</p>

<p>ES4 was so large and so innovative that there were doubts about whether it could be successfully specified and implemented. More worrisome, there was no experience with the language itself. Would the interaction of features cause unintended problems as we saw in ES1 and ES3? The schedule for ES4 required that the standard be put in place and adopted by the browser makers before that question could be answered. This is a problem because once a bug is inserted into a standard, it can be extremely difficult to remove it. All of the features, considered individually, were attractive. But taken as a whole, the language was a mess.</p>

<p>On the other side was a proposal called ES3.1. Its name indicated a less ambitious proposal, being a smaller increment over the current Third Edition. This project was intended to repair as many of the problems with the language as possible while minimizing the pain of disruption. New syntax was considered only when it was already implemented and proven in at least three of the four major browsers. Feature selection tended to favor necessary improvements over desirable improvements.</p>

<p>ES3.1 was more minimal in approach. The set of feature interactions was much smaller and much easier to reason about. ES3.1 is likely to complete its specification and will be the candidate for the Fourth Edition.</p>

<p>ES4 had a large head start (by as much as seven years by some estimates), but was unable to meet its deadlines. Ultimately, the project fell apart when some of the key members left.</p>

<p>Some of the features that were in ES4 were reasonable, so a new project, called Harmony, is starting which will look at adapting the best of ES4 on top of ES3.1. The success of this project will depend on the ability of TC39 to do a better job of managing the tradeoffs between innovation and stability, and adopting a discipline for managing complexity. Simplicity should be highly valued in a standard. Simplicity cannot be added. Instead, complexity must be removed.</p>

<p>It turns out that standard bodies are not good places to innovate. That&#8217;s what laboratories and startups are for. Standards must be drafted by consensus. Standards must be free of controversy. If a feature is too murky to produce a consensus, then it should not be a candidate for standardization. It is for a good reason that &#8220;design by committee&#8221; is a pejorative. Standards bodies should not be in the business of design. They should stick to careful specification, which is important and difficult work.</p>

<p>I see similar stories in HTML5. The early work of WHATWG in documenting the undocumented behavior of HTML was brilliant. It went off the rails when people started to just make new stuff up. There is way too much controversy in HTML5. I would like to see a complete reset with a stronger set of design rules. Things can be much worse than the way things currently are. Having smart people with good intentions is necessary but not sufficient for making good standards.</p>

			<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/yui3.png" alt="YUI 3.0 Preview 1 website." width="280" height="303" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" /></a>The YUI team is pleased to announce the public availability of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/">YUI 3.0 Preview Release 1</a>, an early look at what we&#8217;re working on for the next generation of the YUI Library. <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/">Documentation for YUI 3.0</a> is on the YUI website; the download is available on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/yui/">YUI project area on SourceForge</a>; you can find us with questions or comments on <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/yui3/">the YUI 3.x discussion forum</a>. Keep in mind that this is an early preview, not a production-quality (or even a beta) release. This release is not suitable for production use, but it will give you an idea of what we&#8217;re working on, and it should provide a good framework for conversation about the future of the library.</p>
<h3>Five Goals for YUI 3:</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked to thousands of YUI users over the past 30 months, and based on that feedback we&#8217;ve set five design goals for the next generation of the library. What you&#8217;ve told us is that YUI 3.0 should be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lighter (less K-weight on the wire and on the page for most uses)</li>
  <li>faster (fewer http requests, less code to write and compile, more efficient code)</li>
  <li> more consistent (common naming, event signatures, and widget APIs throughout the library)</li>
  <li> more powerful (do more with less implementation code)</li>
  <li>more securable (safer and easier to expose to multiple developers working in the same environment; easier to run under systems like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/">Caja</a> or <a href="http://adsafe.org/">ADsafe</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>With this early release, we&#8217;ve made progress toward most of these objectives — and we believe we have the right architecture in place  to meet all five as we move to GA over the next few quarters.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New in YUI 3.0?</h3>
<p>When you start to write code using YUI 3.0, you&#8217;ll notice some changes in structure and style. Here&#8217;s a taste:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>Snippet:</td>
    <td>What it does:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>YUI().use('node', function(Y) {
    Y.get('#demo').addClass('enabled');
});
</pre></td>
    <td>Creates a YUI instance with the <code>node</code> module (and any dependencies) and adds the class &quot;enabled&quot; to the element with the <code>id</code> of &quot;demo&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>YUI().use('dd-drag', function(Y) {
        var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#demo'
    });
});</pre></td>
    <td>Creates an instance of YUI with basic drag functionality (a subset of the <code>dd</code> module), and makes the element with the <code>id</code> of &quot;demo&quot; draggable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>Y.all('.demo').addClass('enabled');</pre></td>
    <td>Adds the class &quot;enabled&quot; to the all elements with the <code>className</code> &quot;demo&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>Y.all('.demo').set('title', 'Ready!').removeClass('disabled');</pre></td>
    <td>Sets the title attribute of all elements with the <code>className</code> &quot;demo&quot; and removes the class &quot;disabled&quot; from each.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>Y.get('#demo').plug(Y.Plugin.Drag, {
    handles: 'h2'
});</pre></td>
    <td>Adds the <code>Drag</code> plugin to the element with the <code>id</code> &quot;demo&quot;, and enables all of its <code>h2</code> children drag as handles.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>Y.on('click', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.target.query('em').set('innerHTML', 'clicked');
}, '#demo a');</pre></td>
    <td>Attaches a DOM event listener to all anchor elements that are children of the element with the <code>id</code> &quot;demo&quot;. The event handler prevents the anchor from navigating and then sets a value for the <code>innerHTML</code> of the first <code>em</code> element of the clicked anchor.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>What&#8217;s different here?</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Sandboxing: </em>Each YUI instance on the page can be self-contained, protected and limited (<code>YUI().use()</code>). This segregates it from other YUI instances, tailors the functionality to your specific needs, and lets different versions of YUI play nicely together.</li>
  <li><em>Modularity:</em> YUI 3 is architected to use smaller modular pieces, giving you fine-grained control over what functionality you put on the page. If you simply want to make something draggable, you can include the <code>dd-drag</code> submodule, which is a small subset of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/dd/">Drag &amp; Drop Utility</a>.</li>
  <li><em>Self-completing:</em> As long as the basic YUI seed file is in place, you can make use of any functionality in the library. Tell YUI what modules you want to use, tie that to your implementation code, and YUI will bring in all necessary dependencies in a single HTTP request before executing your code.</li>
  <li><em>Selectors: </em>Elements are targeted using intuitive CSS selector idioms, making it easy to grab an element or a group of elements whenever you&#8217;re performing an operation.</li>
  <li><em>Custom Events++:</em> <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/event/#customevent">Custom Events</a> are even more powerful in YUI 3.0, with support for bubbling, stopping propagation, assigning/preventing default behaviors, and more. In fact, the Custom Event engine provides a common interface for DOM and API events in YUI 3.0, creating a consistent idiom for all kinds of event-driven work.</li>
  <li><em>Nodes and NodeLists:</em> Element references in YUI 3.0 are mediated by <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/node/">Node</a> and NodeList facades. Not only does this make implementation code more expressive (<code>Y.Node.get(&quot;#main ul li&quot;).addClass(&quot;foo&quot;);</code>), it makes it easier to normalize differences in browser behavior (<code>Y.Node.get(&quot;#promo&quot;).setStyle(&quot;opacity&quot;, .5);</code>).</li>
  <li><em>Chaining</em>: We&#8217;ve paid attention throughout the new architecture to the return values of methods and constructors, allowing for a more compressed chaining syntax in implementation code. </li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the beginning. <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/">Dive into the examples</a> to learn more and to see the preview release in action, including some hidden gems like full A-Grade cross-domain requests. Our resident metahacker Dav Glass created a nice multi-component example, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/dd/portal-drag.html">the draggable portal</a>, that will give you some sense of what&#8217;s included in today&#8217;s preview.</p>
<h3>Is YUI 3.0 Backward Compatible with YUI 2.x?</h3>
<p>No. YUI 3.0 builds off of the YUI 2.x codeline, but we&#8217;ve evolved most of the core APIs in working toward the five key goals described above. As a result, migrating from YUI 2.x to 3.x will require effort at the implementation level.</p>
<p>We know that ease-of-migration will be a critical factor for all YUI users. We&#8217;re taking two important steps to facilitate the transition as it arrives:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Limited compatibility layer:</strong> YUI 3.0 will ship with a limited compatibility layer for the current YUI Core (Yahoo Global Object, Dom Collection, and Event Utility). This will allow you to run many of your YUI 2.x-based implementations on top of YUI 3.0. We&#8217;re not shipping the compatibility layer with today&#8217;s preview, but you&#8217;ll see it appear in a future preview or beta release prior to GA.</li>
  <li><strong>Full parallel compatibility:</strong> YUI 3.0 can be run in parallel to YUI 2.x with no side effects for either version. If you choose to make the transition in stages, you can run the full 2.x stack and 3.x stack together as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with these provisions in place, we know that an API change (along with new concepts and idioms) has a real cost for everyone involved. We&#8217;re convinced that this change is both necessary and worth the effort, and obviously we&#8217;re going to work hard to make the value proposition compelling. </p>
<h3>What&#8217;s Next?</h3>
<p>YUI 3.0  is a work in progress. The common widget framework for 3.0 is not included in this preview and we&#8217;re continuing to work on refinements to the core — including optimizations to the package structure to minimize base K-weight. We anticipate the next two releases coming up as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>October 2008 — PR2:</strong> Widget Framework, sample widgets, additional utilities.</li>
  <li><strong>December 2008 — Beta 1:</strong> Final mix of module structures, API completion, full complement of utilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have some great stuff to share as we move further along in this process. We&#8217;ve never been more excited about YUI and its future — and we think YUI 3.0 will have a big role to play in that future.</p>
