The latest installment of [YUI: Open Hours](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/08/introducing-yui-open-hours/) will be this Friday, June 25th.

Last week, [Eduardo Lundgren](http://twitter.com/eduardolundgren) introduced us to some of the great [AlloyUI](http://alloy.liferay.com/) modules recently added to the Gallery. The discussion covered instantiation, configuration, development decisions, and some history of their [TreeView](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/aui-tree-view) module. But that was just the beginning. We also explored their [IO](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/aui-io), [Node](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/aui-node), and [form validation](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/aui-form-validator) modules and spent some time on some of the visual styles available. Eduardo even gave us a sneak preview of the new [Liferay, Inc.](http://liferay.com/) portal, powered by all this hard work. Really top notch work.

All that said, it's hard to say if the show-and-tell or the conversation was the real headliner. Great code related content aside, there was a lot of [good feedback](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3976&hilit=open+hours) and discussion about community collaboration, the nature of the Gallery, and how we can make it and YUI better. So a big thanks to everybody on the call!

This week, we're going to dabble a bit in both the raw developer world as well as the designer world. [Caridy Patiño](http://twitter.com/caridy) is back with us to talk about his [Event Binder](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/event-binder) module that was featured here [just this morning](/yuiblog/blog/2010/06/23/event-binder/). We'll do a code review and discuss the configuration step that has to be done before YUI is even loaded. That's right: pure, unadulterated DOM scripting. You might want to wear a helmet.

Then we'll move on to the equally nuanced skin design process with Jeff Conniff, the yahoo responsible for [the current variety](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/slider/slider_skin.html) of Slider look-and-feels. He'll walk us through his process of building the visual assets and show how you can take the same PSDs and easily create color themed assets that fit in your site palette. Here are the [Photoshop files](/yuiblog/sandbox/yui/openhours/slider_assets.zip) if you want to play along. I'll also talk about some of the decisions made in constructing the CSS and DOM structure of Slider.

We're back to the usual day and time this week: Friday from 10am to 12pm PDT. There's a **new attendee code** for the conference call, but otherwise, the connection details are the same as usual.

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (non-US participants, email me for a local number)
2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953#
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

I've also created a [forum thread](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=4053) for this Open Hours so we can start the discussion early!

Also, as always, you can keep up to date with the upcoming schedule and topics by following [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) on Twitter or subscribing to the [YUI Event Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/calendar/#calendar).

Hope to see you there!
