Last year the "Lightning Talks" session at YUIConf 2012 was one of the more popular segments of the conference. We want to give this year's YUIConf attendees an opportunity give an informal 5-10 minute talk. It can be anything from discussing a site you created using YUI, to a Gallery component you published, or just about anything YUI or even front-end related. This is very informal and can be a great opportunity to get your feet wet in giving presentations.
