The friendly folks at [Konfabulator](http://widgets.yahoo.com/) (the engine behind Yahoo! Widgets) are hosting their first ever [Konfabulator Developer Day](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/187324/) on Thursday, June 7, in Sunnyvale. See the [Developer Day blog post on the Yahoo! Widgets Blog](http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=21) for more on this event and what will be covered.

[![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/171/422986656_dd40fb547b_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/premshree/422986656/)Yahoo! JavaScript architect [Douglas Crockford](http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-TBPekxc1dLNy5DOloPfzVvFIVOWMB0li) will be keynoting the conference with a talk entitled "JavaScript: The Good Parts." This brand-new presentation grows out of Douglas's conviction that JavaScript is a muddle. Much of it is incredibly good; much of it is flawed. The standards bodies won't fix JavaScript because they can only add to what's there...they can't remove the parts that are ill-conceived or harmful. Douglas advises that developers approach JavaScript the way Michaelangelo approached an unsculpted block of marble — that is, with an eye toward its intrinsic beauty. In this talk, he'll try to guide you toward the intrinsic beauty of JavaScript.

The [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) hopes to be there to record the talk, but if you're a Yahoo! Widgets developer (or are interested in becoming one) and you'd like to hear Douglas's latest thoughts about the language, this is a great opportunity to catch one of his lectures in person.
