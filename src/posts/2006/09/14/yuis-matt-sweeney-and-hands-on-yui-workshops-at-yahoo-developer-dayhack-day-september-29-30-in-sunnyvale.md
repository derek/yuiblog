YUI Developer (and after-hours DJ) **Matt Sweeney** will be among the featured speakers at Yahoo!'s first [Developer Day/Public Hack Day](http://hackday.org) on September 29, 2006. ([Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/schill/236624638/in/set-72157594273058359/): Scott Schiller.)

[As you've no doubt heard](http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000357.html), Yahoo! is hosting its first-ever [open Hack Day/Developer Day](http://hackday.org/) in two weeks. The focus of the Developer Day proceedings is on software created with (and for) an ecosystem of API-driven, web-accessible applications and services. Featured speakers during the Friday, Sept. 29, Developer Day event include [Bradley Horowitz](http://www.elatable.com/) talking about the Yahoo! API ecosystem and Iain Lamb (formerly of Oddpost) talking about the new portfolio of skills required to be a "hacker of the ecosystem."

Also addressing the conference in the featured-speakers track will be YUI developer **Matt Sweeney**, author of the [YUI Dom Collection](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/) and [YUI Animation Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/). Matt's 2:30 p.m. talk, "Web 2.0: Getting It Right the Second Time Around," will focus on the role that frontend archtecture (x/html, css, JavaScript) plays in creating web applications that perform well in the ecosystem, making the sharing and reuse of information practical, scalable, and accessible across different (and unanticipated) contexts.

The Developer Day schedule features multiple concurrent tracks. In addition to the featured-speakers track, YUI authors will be hosting hands-on introductions to [the YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) throughout the day on Friday. These are "getting-started" sessions in which developers walk participants through basic use cases for various library components. Here's the tentative schedule for Friday's workshops:

-   10 a.m. **CSS Reset, Fonts and Grids**, Nate Koechley
-   11 a.m. **Event Utility**, Adam Moore
-   11 a.m. **Animation Utility**, Matt Sweeney
-   2:30 p.m. **Menu Control**, Todd Kloots
-   3:30 p.m. **Container (Panel & Dialog Controls)**, Steven Peterson
-   4:30 p.m. **Connection Manager**, Thomas Sha

Several YUI team members will also be on hand Saturday for the open Hack Day, to be capped with presentations and awards emceed by the estimable Mike Arrington of TechCrunch fame. If your hack uses YUI, we'll be there to help you work through any issues that might come up. The internal Hack Days at Yahoo! have been incredible experiences...this first open session promises to be even more diverse and compelling.

I hope you'll come join us for this unique opportunity to meet and engage with the terrific developers behind the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/). The [Hack Day website](http://hackday.org/) (hackday.org) is taking requests for attendance (see the form at the bottom of the Hack Day page); sign up now to get on the list for additional information about the schedule, attendance and workshop participation.

This is a big event for those of us involved with YUI and for Yahoo! generally; developers from throughout the Yahoo! ecosystem (including [Cal Henderson](http://www.iamcal.com/) from Flickr, engineers from Yahoo! Maps, JSON inventor [Douglas Crockford](http://360.yahoo.com/douglascrockford), PHP creator [Rasmus Lerdorf](http://lerdorf.com/), and many more) will be speaking on development in the still-emerging mashup software culture.
