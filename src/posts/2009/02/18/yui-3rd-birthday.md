![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yui-3rd-birthday/three.png)The YUI Library turned three years old this month and we'd like to invite you -- our community of developers and implementers -- to come out and celebrate! To celebrate our third birthday (and our 2.7.0 release), we'll be hosting a recession-chic happy hour at the Blue Chalk Cafe in downtown Palo Alto, Thursday, February 26 from 6:00 to 8:00 pm. Nothing too fancy, but we'll have fun goodies to give away and the first few rounds of drinks are on us (until the tab runs out). Details and signups are at [Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1850956). Hope to see you there!
