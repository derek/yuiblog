[![Flickr Frontend Engineering Manager Ross Harmes talks about the process of rewriting the Flickr front end using YUI 3.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf2010-harmes-20101116-151159.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-harmes)

Ross Harmes is the Frontend Engineering Manger for Flickr, which recently completed a major presentation-tier rewrite using YUI 3. He was kind enough to join us at [YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/) to talk about that rewrite and how he and his team extracted maximum benefit from YUI 3's various components.
