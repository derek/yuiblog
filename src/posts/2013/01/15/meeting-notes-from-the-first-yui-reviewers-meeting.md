At YUIConf [I announced the new Contributor Model](/yuiblog/blog/2012/11/19/you-are-the-yui-team-yuiconf-2012-recap-keynote-video/). I was nominated as the first official YUI Reviewer and I have been working hard lately to uphold that status. Late last night, I stepped out for a smoke and a Dew and had the first official Reviewers meeting and here are the notes:

> **Reviewers Present:** Me, Myself and I **Call to Order** Dav called the meeting to order at 10pm CST and he also recorded the minutes. A quorum of reviewers was present, and the meeting, having been duly convened, was ready to proceed with business. **Reviewer Report** Welcome to the first YUI Reviewers Meeting. **New Business** Reviewer #1 would like to nominate a second Reviewer. It is recognized that [Eric Ferraiuolo](https://github.com/ericf) has earned the right to be nominated and would make a valuable addition to the Reviewers list. **Voting** All in favor: Dav All opposed: \[crickets\] Reviewer status approved, Welcome Eric! **Closed Session** No other business on the books, adjourning. **Adjournment** There being no further business to come before the meeting, the meeting was adjourned at 10:01 pm CST.

Eric is a fantastic engineer and strives to help our code and our community, please help me welcome him!
