We are announcing a new release candidate for you to try out: **3.17.2-rc-1**. You can find it on the [Yahoo CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.17.2-rc-1/build/yui/yui-min.js), via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/yui), and download it via the `.zip` [archive](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.17.2-rc-1.zip). We have also updated the [staging website](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/) for this release candidate.

This release candidate is targeted to fix [Loader](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/Loader.html) regression issues from **3.17.0**. We found and fixed one such issue and released **3.17.1**. However other [issues](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1837) are being discovered, so please take this opportunity to download the release candidate and try it out in your own test environments, especially if you are having issues with **3.17.1**. Please send your feedback and [file issues](https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/new). They have a direct positive impact on each and every release. You can check out what's changed in this release by viewing the [code comparison](https://github.com/yui/yui3/compare/v3.17.1...release-3.17.2-rc-1) on GitHub.

When filing a bug for this release please include the **module name** and the **YUI version** in the title.
