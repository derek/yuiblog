It's a new week, and time for another [YUI: Open Hours](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/08/introducing-yui-open-hours/)!

This week, we'll be joined by the inimitable [Dav Glass](http://twitter.com/davglass), author of (among other things) YUI's [Rich Text Editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/) and [Drag and Drop utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/dd/), and the primary architect behind [yuilibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com) and the [Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery) itself. He'll be discussing the YUI 3 Gallery project — where it's going, how to contribute — and answer any questions about it, about the site, or really about anything else while we have him on the line.

After that, we'll jump into our main event, which will be a "Gallery widget sampler". We have a number of module authors joining us this week, including

-   Iliyan Peychev ([Accordion](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/accordion))
-   [Andrew Bialecki](http://twitter.com/abialecki) ([Lightbox](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/lightbox))
-   [Matt Snider](http://www.mattsnider.com/) ([Radial Menu](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/radialmenu))
-   [Jacob Fogg](http://twitter.com/jacobfogg) ([Sliding Sidebar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/sliding-sidebar))
-   and hopefully more

They'll introduce their module, give an example or two, go over their API, and discuss their experience creating it. Besides just being a nice introduction to additional components available to YUI 3 users, it should provide a good platform to talk about widget API best practices and help give a sense of some of the decisions that are made during widget creation.

Thanks again to [Caridy Patiño](http://twitter.com/caridy) for joining us [last week](/yuiblog/blog/2010/05/13/yui-open-hours-friday-may-14th/) and reviewing his [Accordion Node plugin](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/node-accordion) and [Dispatcher](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/dispatcher) modules. We'll have more topics in the future about creating Node plugins and the reasons why the plugin approach or the widget approach might be a better fit for your needs. And thanks to [Matt Sweeney](http://twitter.com/msweeney) (author of YUI's [Node](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/node/) class and selector engine) for dropping in as a surprise guest as well.
