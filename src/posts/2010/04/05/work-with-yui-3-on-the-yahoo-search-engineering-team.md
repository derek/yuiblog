Next generation search engines are not just about serving plain search results anymore. At Yahoo!, we are striving to provide the most compelling search experience for a given query by taking into account many dynamic parameters including user intent, geolocation and user-agent capabilities. We are also a technology provider, developing the engine behind many Yahoo! services.

In order to achieve these lofty goals, the Yahoo! Search team is now hiring superstar client- and server-side engineers. If you have a passion for solving difficult problems and enjoy writing beautiful code that's well documented and maintainable, you're well on your way to joining our team. On the client, we make extensive use of the YUI library (both [YUI 2](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/2/ "YUI 2 — Yahoo! User Interface Library") and [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/ "YUI 3 — Yahoo! User Interface Library")) and often contribute features to it.

[Yahoo! Search](http://search.yahoo.com/ "Yahoo! Search - Web Search") handles millions of queries every single day, and caters to over 500 million individual users worldwide in more than 40 international markets. These mind boggling numbers make Yahoo! Search engineering one of the best opportunities to make a difference in the lives of people located in all corners of the world.
