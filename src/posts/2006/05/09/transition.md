In this release of the Yahoo! Design Pattern Library we are offering a set of 11 patterns for creating visual transitions. These come under the umbrella of the [Transition](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/parent.php?pattern=transition) pattern.

There is no doubt that visual transitions can be abused. In fact, many of them could become in Web 2.0 what the <blink> tag became for Web 1.0.

We offer this set of patterns to help create a language around the various effects as well as hopefully provide some sane guidance to their use.

I recently wrote a detailed blog article on this topic. It's called [Mind Hacking Visual Transitions](http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2006/03/mind-hacking-visual-transi_114376913301122246.html). In it I explore what makes transitions work. Here's a hint: the brain has a special processing place for visual transitions! That's right. That's why ads are often so distracting. I invite you to read the article and then check out our set of [Transition patterns](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/parent.php?pattern=transition).
