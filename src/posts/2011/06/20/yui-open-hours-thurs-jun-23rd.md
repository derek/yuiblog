### Preview of the windowing improvements in 3.4.0

One of the active areas of development in YUI 3.4.0 is in Windowing components. By taking advantage of YUI3's modular architecture, we're building components that can be mixed and matched by developers to create some awesome windowing solutions.

In 3.4.0PR2, we're releasing some of these modules, like modal widgets and synced `WidgetPositionAlign`. We'll look at these and more, talk about their Gallery origins and about our goals for richer windowing support in 3.4.0

### Time & Details

We'll be online from **10am to 11am PDT Thursday**. The connection details are the same as usual.

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (Skype works great for non-US participants\*)
2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953#
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

_Note_: Because it's an open conference line, we ask that callers **mute their lines** unless they are participating in active discussion.

\* - If Skype is not an option, email me or catch me (ls\_n) in the #yui IRC channel on freenode for a local number.
