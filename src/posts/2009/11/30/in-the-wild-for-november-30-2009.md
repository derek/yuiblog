As we get back into the swing of things post-Thanksgiving in the US, here are some of the YUI-related items we've noted in recent weeks. If we missed something, let us know in the comments; if you'd like to contribute an article to YUIBlog on your own YUI-related work, we'd love to see it — please see the [contribution guidelines](/yuiblog/contribute/) and send your article over.

-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/aws-yui-utility-20091124-114114.png)](http://www.mattsnider.com/widget/amazon-web-services-utility/)**[Matt Snider's YUI 3/PHP "Amazon Web Services Utility"](http://www.mattsnider.com/widget/amazon-web-services-utility/):** A great new project from Matt Snider, author of the [YUI Storage Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/storage/) and lead frontend at Mint.com: "Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a powerful tool for finding and evaluating just about any type of material goods. Whether you are searching by keywords or the UPC code, AWS can provide just about all the information you will ever need to know about a product. However, Amazon has put a lot of hurdles between you and the information you needs. First, as of August 15, 2009, AWS now requires that you sign all your requests. Secondly, they have terrible documentation and confusing error messages that do not always explain how to fix the problem.  [Amazon Web Services Utility](http://www.mattsnider.com/widget/amazon-web-services-utility/) is a [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/) JavaScript/PHP solution that simplifies interacting with AWS by handling the request signing process automatically and securely, and prevening or handling common errors. In addition to returning the result as XML, there is an additional 'gallery-aws-json' package that adds functionality to parse the XML data into JSON objects."
-   **[YUI 2 in Use at PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/):** We've known this for awhile, but I gather we haven't mentioned it on YUIBlog in the past: [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) is one of many consumer financial sites using YUI.  Currently, we're seeing YUI 2.7.0 Yahoo, Dom, Event, Animation and Connection Manager on some pages in the PayPal workflow.

-   **[CutMyPic Site Using YUI ImageCropper and More](http://www.cutmypic.com/):** Writes [Sean](/yuiblog/2009/10/22/in-the-wild-for-october-22-2009/#comment-586339): "Me and a friend [built this little tool](http://www.cutmypic.com/) as we found ourselves always wanting to crop images, round their corners, and add a drop shadow, but didn’t want to open up the CPU hungry CS4 every time.  In this site, we utilize [YUI Reset](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/), [YUI ImageCropper](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imagecropper/), and [YUI Slider](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/). Although still in it’s beta form, we felt like the YUI ImageCropper was the easiest to modify in addition to not having to worry about any internal library conflicts."

-   **[YUI 2 and 3 in Use on ActiveLog.com](http://www.activelog.com/):** Chris from [ActiveLog](http://www.activelog.com/) [wrote in](/yuiblog/2009/11/13/in-the-wild-for-november-13-2009/#comment-586612) to tell us "about a set of health and fitness sites that utilize YUI 2.x (soon to add some 3.x). We utilize the Connection Manager, TreeView, Dialog, Slider, and Calendar. ActiveLog is probably the most popular site we use these on, but we have a handful of other partner sites that use the same technologies via our fitness-partners.com site."

-   **[Improving YUI 3 DataSchema-XML](http://www.mattsnider.com/widget/improving-yui3-dataschame-xml/):** From the prolific Matt Snider: "I have recently been working on finalizing the [Amazon Web Services Utility](http://www.mattsnider.com/widget/amazon-web-services-utility/), which now supports all the non-cart operations and almost all the possible response groups. In the course of developing the JSON version of the utility, I had the opportunity to work closely with YUI3's DataSchema-XML, and realized its several shortcomings: it doesn't support nested schemas, the `resultListLocator` cannot be an XPath statement, and all lookups fail if the Amazon XML namespace is included. This article will look at how I implemented the first two improvements..."

-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/jekyll-base-20091126-091017.png)](http://raphinou.github.com/jekyll-base/)**[Jekyll Base Powered by YUI CSS Grids](http://raphinou.github.com/jekyll-base/):** Raphael Bauduin has posted his Jekyll Base project to GitHub.  Writes Raphael: "I was looking for a fast and simple way to maintain documentation for [Dedomenon](http://dedomenon.github.com/documentation), the information storage engine behind [MyOwnDB.Com](http://myowndb.com). I was looking for a hosted system I didn’t have to maintain, but that would still give me full control of the content so I can move it to another system later if I want to." [You can read more about the project on Raphael's blog ("Jekyll, YUI and GitHub: A Great Combination")](http://www.nsa.be/index.php/eng/Blog/Jekyll-YUI-and-Github-a-great-combination).

-   **[KidZui Website Using YUI 2 Grids](http://www.kidzui.com/):** We don't do a great job of calling attention to all the sites using one of [YUI 2](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/2/)'s most popular components: [CSS Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/).  Here's one that caught our attention recently -- the website for [KidZui](http://www.kidzui.com/), a browser for children 3-12. Great idea, nicely implemented.

-   **[@triptych, "YUI3 Turns NIMBY into BYBBQ"](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2009/11/19/yui3-turns-nimby-into-bybbq/):** [Andrew Wooldridge writes](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2009/11/19/yui3-turns-nimby-into-bybbq/http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2009/11/19/yui3-turns-nimby-into-bybbq/): "As I’ve been poking around in YUI3, much to its annoyance mind you, since nobody likes to be poked, I’ve notice something very different about it. With many javascript libraries, you get the sense that the authors would very much like you to give up all work in other libraries and join the “one true faith” of this library. Instead of using your own code to do drag and drop use OURS. Instead of using jQuery’s AJAX, use OURS. Instead, I get the impression that YUI3 is much more pragmatic in its purpose. Instead of chaining you to one way of doing things, it has this idea of “bringing in” libraries and functions when you actually need them, instead of dumping let another few milliseconds onto your site’s pageload at the beginning. This really frees you up because you can just load the bare bones set of code you need to get things going, and pull in other libraries on demand. It’s almost like LOD for javascript...."  He's got more to say...[keep reading on his blog](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2009/11/19/yui3-turns-nimby-into-bybbq/).
