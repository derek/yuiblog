Next week the YUI team will begin planning for release 2.9.0 to be shipped in the second half of Q1 2011. YUI 2.9.0 will be the last major dot-release of the 2.x codeline, and the team will be aggressively reviewing all open tickets against the YUI 2 project and either assigning them to be a part of the 2.9.0 release, closing them as "WON'T FIX", or moving them to the YUI 3 project.

The reality of time and resource constraints forces us to focus on top priority items that will provide some closure to YUI 2.x and allow us to redouble our efforts on 3.x development. Here are some of the criteria that we'll be using to guide us in deciding what should be included in release 2.9.0:

-   Issues that negatively impact core use cases.
-   Emerging issues related to new browser releases on the A-grade matrix.
-   Enhancements and new features will be de-prioritized for YUI 2 and considered for YUI 3.

The transition of the YUI team from developing two parallel codelines to focusing solely on YUI 3 does not mean the end of the YUI 2 project. All present and future YUI 2 releases will continue to be hosted on the Yahoo! CDN, the YUI 2 codebase will continue to be hosted in GitHub, and we'd like to explore community-based maintenance of YUI 2 in the future.

As we continue our planning process, we'll be fine-tuning our schedule, looking for feedback from the community, and communicating progress updates throughout the release cycle.
