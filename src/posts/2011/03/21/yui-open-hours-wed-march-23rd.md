### YUI 3 Cookbook first look

It hasn't been well publicized, but we have a YUI 3 Cookbook in the works and [Evan Goer](http://www.goer.org) is the man in charge. Evan has been a technical writer for nearly 15 years, which means we trust him to do a better job writing it than we would have (we'll stick to coding). So this week we'll introduce you to Evan, and give you a chance to see and give feedback on some of the book's initial content and structure.

Also this week, [Steven Roussey](http://twitter.com/sroussey) will be on the call, demoing [Illuminations plugin for FireBug](http://www.illuminations-for-developers.com/) that allows you to see the YUI 3 objects behind the DOM structure and more.

### Time & Details

We'll be online from **10am to 11am PDT Wednesday**. The connection details are the same as usual.
