While the [Architecture of a Review](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_architectureofreview.php "Architecture of Review Pattern") pattern discusses the information architecture elements of a review, This pattern focuses on the interaction design for reviews. We typically use the [Rating an Object](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_ratinganobject.php "Rating an object pattern") pattern in conjunction with this pattern.

The pattern can be found at: [Writing a Review](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_writingareview.php).
