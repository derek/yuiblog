_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   This week at [CSSConf](http://cssconf.com/) the YUI team released [Pure](http://purecss.io/), a set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project. You can find more details in the [release announcement](/yuiblog/2013/05/30/pure/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/yui/pure/). Thanks to all those involved in the development of the project and to the community for such positive feedback! If you'd like to get started using Pure, there are a few ways to include it in your project; you can fetch [pure-min.css](http://yui.yahooapis.com/pure/0.1.0/pure-min.css) from Yahoo's CDN ([via `link` tag](https://github.com/yui/pure/blob/master/README.md#get-started)), install via [Bower](http://bower.io/) (`$ bower install --save pure`), or even [build it from source](https://github.com/yui/pure/blob/master/README.md#build-from-source). If you have any ideas, bugs, or feedback, please file [an issue](https://github.com/yui/pure/issues).
    
-   This week we're putting finishing touches and polish on the next release of YUI which is currently slated for release next week. In accordance with [SemVer](http://semver.org/), this release will get a minor version bump and be tagged as `v3.10.2`, meaning there are no introductions of code that provide new features or may break backwards compatibility. For a running list of everything included, take a look at the [v3.10.1...dev-master diff](https://github.com/yui/yui3/compare/v3.10.1...dev-master). We'll include a more detailed breakdown of changes in the release announcement.
    
-   In this week's [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable) ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0yATfPmhWA)) we introduced another one of our summer interns. Welcome Rashad Russell ([@rashadrussell](http://github.com/rashadrussell))! Core team member Tilo Mitra ([@tilomitra](https://twitter.com/tilomitra)) reprised his CSSConf presentation of [Pure](http://purecss.io/), and we discussed why there are many new GitHub issues being filed for failing tests (answer: inclusion of new CI environments, not regressions).
