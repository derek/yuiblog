In the [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) world of late:

-   **The guy who started it all:** Thomas Sha, the founder of the YUI project and the first frontend engineering manager at Yahoo, was at Adobe at the time of the AIR launch awhile back [and they shot some video](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/ajax/articles/ajax_interviews.html#swf4). If you're curious to hear from the person who started YUI, here's a rare chance (while notorious at Yahoo, Thomas does not spend a lot of time on the conference circuit).

-   **More YUIers in the wild**: [Andre Charland interviewed YUI CSS guru Nate Koechley](http://www.insideria.com/2008/06/podcast-yui-with-nate-koechley.html) for his InsideRIA podcast recently; frequent YUIBlog contributor Christian Heilmann from the Yahoo Developer Network spoke to the folks at The Guardian about his development philosophy, and [Inside's Paul Carvill has a writeup](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/inside/2008/07/chris_heilmann_from_yahoo.html).
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/canvasgraph.png)](http://www.500null.com/?p=16)**Canvas graphing with a touch of YUI:** Adam Detrick on 500null has a nice canvas-graphing example that makes use of YUI's [Dom Collection](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/) to build [a progressively enhanced bar chart using inline tabular data](http://www.500null.com/?p=16).
-   **Ojay increments:** James Coglan [has updated his chaining library for YUI, Ojay, to 0.20](http://ojay.othermedia.org/). Writes James: "We have two new UI packages, [Ojay.Overlay](http://ojay.othermedia.org/articles/overlays.html) and [Ojay.Paginator](http://ojay.othermedia.org/articles/paginator.html). Overlay gives you a bunch of classes for positioning content on top of the document, producing lightbox effects and the like, and Paginator implements the content slider effect that’s got a lot of attention recently, including the ability to lazy-load pages of content via Ajax, and easy integration with [Ojay.History](http://ojay.othermedia.org/articles/history.html). Both packages come with a collection of events to allow your code to react to changes to the components, just like you would for DOM elements." [Dion has the full story on Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/archives/ojay-02-easy-keyboarding-a-validation-dsl-and-two-new-ui-widgets).
-   **Mighty parched over here...:** Jenny Donnelly has worked hard on DataTable over the past year, and there's nothing more gratifying to me than to see her work put to good use — [in this case, providing us with the ability to sort Irish whiskeys by age](http://explorer.irishwhiskeynotes.com/) (descending, naturally). Now, that's worth pouring a Dungourney for. Cheers to David and the team.
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/mapplus.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2394)**Maps+ FF Extension:** Yahoo Maps is all YUI-based, and so is Rahim Sonawalla's nifty [YUI-based Maps+ Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2394). Like others in this category, Map+ allows you to highlight any address in a web page and map the address inline via a context menu.
-   **Dynamic dialogs with Rails and YUI:** [Eric Hedberg from Enleitened has posted his second in a series of posts about using YUI with Rails](http://enleitened.com/2008/06/26/dynamic-dialogs-with-rails-and-yui/). This time he's taking on dialogs. "In the [last tutorial](http://enleitened.com/2008/06/07/instant-shiny-forms-with-rails-and-yui/), we embedded a hidden form in a 'show' view, so we could render a [YUI Dialog](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/dialog/) instead of loading the edit page separately, or using a technique like in-place editing. While this is useful, I find it to be of somewhat limited utility. In this article I’ll demonstrate a technique to move that dialog to the index view using the [YUI Connection Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/), so we can skip the show step all together."
-   **YUI template for Blogger:** Will Stranathan posts on his Will at Home blog about [implementing a YUI CSS-based Blogger template](http://will.thestranathans.com/2008/06/howto-blogger-template-in-yui.html) with full details on how to get this going on your own blog.
-   **YPulse from Trendics:** Kent Johnson from Trendics posted [his YUI-based solution for colored pulse alerts, YPulse](http://blog.trendics.com/development/yui/using-yui-to-pulse-elements-on-web-pages-to-improve-usability/): "Show a green highlight that fades away on a table row when a new record is added by a user. Add a pulsing yellow glow to a button you want the user to press next. With this open source YPulse library and YUI, both are easy to implement."
-   **Website Speed Check:** Also from Trendics, the new [Website Speed Check](http://tools.trendics.com/website-speed-check) tool tests the access time for your website (via a HTTP HEAD request) from locations around the US and reports them in a YUI DataTable. Can't wait to see some Charts integration here.

-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/darkmatter.png)](http://www.pixelpost.org/extend/templates/dark-matter/)**Marco van Hylckama Vlieg's Dark Matter Theme for Pixelpost:** Marco writes: "As much as I love Pixelpost, I found that one thing was lacking: a rock solid theme made with web development best practices in mind. I found some decent ones but nothing I really liked enough to put on my own site. Therefore I decided to roll my own and then make it available for all Pixelpost users to use." The result is [the gorgeous Dark Matter theme](http://www.pixelpost.org/extend/templates/dark-matter/). You can [see it in action on Marco's own photography site](http://www.i-marco.nl/photoblog/).
-   **Asvin Balloo's JavaScript Text Magnifier:** [Writes Asvin regarding his magnifier](http://htmlblog.net/simple-yui-cookie-example/): "The piece of code we will be writing, using the YUI library (my favorite), will allow users to increase/decrease their font size for a block of text, storing the font size in a cookie so that when they return to the page they don't have to modify the font size again." While Firefox 3 and Opera are starting to lead the way in full-page zooming, this trick is still a nice one for readers who can benefit from an adjustable font size.
