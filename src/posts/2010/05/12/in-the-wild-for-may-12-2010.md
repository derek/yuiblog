-   **[Mich Cook's YUI/YQL-based Module for Searching a Set of Docs](http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2010/05/ydn_rack_module_search_within_a_document_set.html):**  
    Yahoo! engineer Mich Cook developed a piece of YUI- and YQL-based code for the [Yahoo! Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.com/) website that he's shared on their blog.  Writes Mich: "This block of code creates the YDN Rack module that supports searching within a set of docs. Previously, the only search functionality would scour the entire site for the terms entered. This module aims to provide contextual search within documentation so a user can more easily find something related to the docs currently being presented. We use a bunch of y! technology to do the heavy lifting and that's awesome that we just have to manufacture the glue."[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/ydnrack-20100505-124732.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2010/05/ydn_rack_module_search_within_a_document_set.html)

-   **[Noah Masterson (@noahvail) on the Virtues of YUI](http://www.noahmasterson.com/2010/05/5-things-yahoo-does-better-than-google-and-everyone-else.html):** Noah's [note about YUI](http://www.noahmasterson.com/2010/05/5-things-yahoo-does-better-than-google-and-everyone-else.html): "The YUI library is an extensive collection of JavaScript and CSS tools. Basically, YUI provides everything a front-end web developer/designer needs, short of HTML and content.  Because Yahoo! uses YUI for its own applications, the code has already been tested at one of the most visited sites on the web, it has to work in all major browsers, and it's likely to be supported and updated for a long time to come.There's no other library that provides a combined JavaScript and CSS solution of YUI's caliber, but even separately, I'd probably use its tools in my web projects. YUI's CSS framework is the best I've tried (Blueprint is pretty nice, too). As for JavaScript libraries, picking one is often a matter of preference. For example, plenty of people love jQuery, which has a great community that creates plugins to extend the library. I prefer YUI, because it has so much included functionality and it mixes in seamlessly with the other JavaScript I write.  Finally, the genius of YUI isn't just the library itself. Yahoo! has stocked the developers' area of their site with excellent videos, examples, and documentation, making it easy to get started with the library -- and providing a path to becoming an expert." Thanks for the kind words, Noah.

Today I’m going to show you how to do persistent Client-side storage that’ll work in any Web Browser without needing to use Cookies, Browser-Specific hacks or HTML5 – in other words, we’re going to store as much custom information as a site needs on a user’s system without needing to worry about compatibility issues. The reason we’re interested in doing this is because it has a huge potential to free up database resources if we don’t need to be saving information there – instead it can be readily loaded from our users computer through client-side storage. Even if you need to save data, you can always store it on your user’s system and log it to the server it at a later date in the week."
