Developing server-side applications with javascript is a hot topic right now, and Mojito is a great choice for building robust apps. This talk from [Diego Ferreiro](https://twitter.com/diervo) will give you some idea of the potential of Mojito, and we encourage you to check out the other videos in this series on our [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByU2zn9DmAA&list=PLjKP9DUCzZooMmiSJ_nmsLIReOZp0Uomz) (and [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/)).

In this YUIConf 2012 talk, Yahoo! front-end engineer and security expert Diego Ferreiro talks about why and how Yahoo!'s web stack was migrated to Node.JS and the Cocktails platform. Diego discusses various advantages of using Node.JS and Mojito, including scalability, code reuse, support for multiple devices, low overhead, and a logical deployment process.
