-   **[Matt Snider's New YUI-based Card Game Engine](http://mattsnider.com/my-projects/first-look-generic-card-game-system/):** The prolific Matt Snider weighs in with a new project.  [Writes Matt](http://mattsnider.com/my-projects/first-look-generic-card-game-system/): "The goal of this system is to build a set of easy to extend, MVC JavaScript objects that can be used as the backbone of any card-game system. I will be tackling solitaire card games first, and have developed the card management architecture, but haven’t even begun to design the game architecture.  The card architecture consists of three objects: Deck, CardModel, CardView. The ‘Deck’ object will handle a collection of cards and has methods to add or remove cards, and a shuffle method using the Knuth algorithm. Games are played by interacting with the ‘Deck’ object and a developer would extend the object to meet the needs of their game."  Check out the [blog post](http://mattsnider.com/my-projects/first-look-generic-card-game-system/) and [demo](http://www.mattsnider.com/tests/test_cardSystem.html).

Yahoo has baked in sidebar widths that correspond with the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s ad guidelines.  \[And\] with multiple templates and the ability to nest page regions, Yahoo claims to offer over 1000 layout combination . . . all in less than 5kb."  [Check out his full tutorial](http://blog.themeforest.net/tutorials/crash-course-yui-grids-css/) for more.

-   **[In-depth into Cookies with YUI Cookie Utility Author](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/05/05/http-cookies-explained/):** Nicholas C. Zakas, author of the [YUI Cookie Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/cookie/) among other virtuous projects, has [a detailed article on browser cookies up on his blog](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/05/05/http-cookies-explained/).  Writes Nicholas: "HTTP cookies, most often just called 'cookies,' have been around for a while but are still not very well understood. The first problem is a lot of misconceptions, ranging from cookies as spyware or viruses to just plain ignorance over how they work. The second problem is a lack of consistent interfaces to work with cookies. Despite all of the issues surrounding them, cookies are such an important part of web development that, should they disappear without a replacement, many of our favorite web applications would be rendered useless."  [Check out his article for more](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/05/05/http-cookies-explained/), including one or two notes about YUI Cookie support.

While this does not necessarily improve the web architecture, it does make it more fun. To promote more easter eggs like that, I decided to write a simple script that makes integrating the Konami code into your site trivial."
