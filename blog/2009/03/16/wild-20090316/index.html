			<li id="yuiBlogWild-204"><strong><a href="http://www.helloecho.com/">Ticketmaster Subsidiary Echo Using YUI Menus and DataTables</a>:</strong> Geoff Alday from Ticketmaster subsidiary <a href="http://www.helloecho.com/">echo</a> wrote in to tell us about a terrific implementation of YUI that his team has engineered as part of its echotools product.&nbsp; "We use a large number of YUI components but these screenshots specifically show implementations of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/">Menu</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">DataTable</a>. Originally we chose <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> because we had been using another toolkit and found it cumbersome to use, heavy, and poorly documented. YUI seemed a lot faster, well documented, and properly tested. YUI also posted their browser testing practices, so we were comfortable it would cover the browsers we were supporting. Additionally, Yahoo! was and is using YUI themselves, which makes YUI more appealing."&nbsp; echo creates websites for bands and focuses on "opening a powerful channel for conversation between entertainment brands and their consumers."&nbsp; The YUI implementations are behind a login and are used to power the analytics provided to echo's customers.<br /><a href="http://www.helloecho.com/"><img src="/blog-archive/assets/echotools-20090304-155905.jpg" vspace="10" /></a><li id="yuiBlogWild-205"><strong><a href="http://clickontyler.com/blog/2009/03/yui-app-theme/">Tyler Hall's YUI App Theme Built with YUI Grids CSS</a>:</strong> Writes Tyler: "Tonight I pushed a new project to GitHub called <a href="http://github.com/tylerhall/yui-app-theme/">yui-app-theme</a>. It’s a generic, skinnable layout designed for web applications — particularly admin areas — built using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">YUI Grids</a>. In other words, it’s a <em>starting point</em>. Usually when doing freelance work for clients, unless you’re building on top of an existing CMS like <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> or <a href="http://miacms.org/">MiaCMS</a>, you’ll have to create an admin area for the client to login and manage their site. Or maybe you’re building a bug tracker or some other web application. Whatever the situation, yui-app-theme provides a solid foundation to start your work."<br /><a href="http://clickontyler.com/blog/2009/03/yui-app-theme/"><img src="/blog-archive/assets/yuiapptheme-20090309-135427.jpg" vspace="10" /></a><li id="yuiBlogWild-210"><strong><a href="http://www.webgui.org/">YUI Sighting — WebGUI CMS</a>:</strong> The free (GPL) WebGUI CMS employs a wide range of YUI components, including a nice implementation of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/">sliders</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/colorpicker/">color pickers</a> that facilitate the theming in the admin interface.<br /><a href="http://www.webgui.org/"><img src="/blog-archive/assets/webgui-20090312-145323.jpg" vspace="10" /></a><li id="yuiBlogWild-211"><strong><a href="http://ispidr.com/">YUI Sighting -- ISpidr.com, New Geo-aware Social Networking App</a>:</strong> <a href="http://ispidr.com/">Spidr</a> is a new geo-aware social networking app "that helps you connect with people who could be sitting next to you in a coffee shop or pub or go to the same school or work in the same building as you do.

Writes Iain: "This pattern fascinates me – not just as a javascript programmer, but as a computer scientist. At its core, this beauty is a simple anonymous function expression, capable of appearing within itself again and again (because it’s an expression containing expressions).&nbsp; This concise lambda pattern pretty much describes <em>every block of javascript I’ve written in recent memory</em> – ranging from modest expressions embedded into somebody else’s code to all the way to entire programs. You’re basically looking at source code of every javascript file I’ve produced in the last several years."&nbsp; <a href="http://lamb.cc/blog/2009/02/22/javascript-lambdas/">Check out his blog post for sample code</a>.<li id="yuiBlogWild-207"><a href="http://grails.org/GrailsUI+Plugin"><img align="right" hspace="10" src="/blog-archive/assets/GrailsUI1.0-20090310-114646.jpg" vspace="5" /></a><strong><a href="http://grails.org/GrailsUI+Plugin">Grails UI 1.0 Released for YUI and Bubbling Library</a>:</strong> The popular <a href="http://grails.org/GrailsUI+Plugin">GrailsUI project</a> has hit the important 1.0 release milestone.&nbsp; GrailsUI brings broad YUI support to Grails and includes <a href="http://bubbling-library.com/">Caridy Patiño Mayea's excellent Bubbling Library</a> as well.&nbsp; The documentation is fantastic, and support is provided for a wide range of YUI's widgets, including <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">DataTables</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/">Rich Text Editors</a>, and much more.&nbsp; Congratulations to <a href="http://weblog.dangertree.net/2008/10/31/grailsui-10-released/">Matthew Taylor, whose blog post has much more detail on the release</a>.
