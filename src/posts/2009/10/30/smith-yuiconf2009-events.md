We wrapped up [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) last night, and I wanted to share with you the first video coming out of the sessions. This is from YUI engineer [Luke Smith](http://lucassmith.name/)'s ([@ls\_n](http://twitter.com/ls_n)'s) presentation yesterday, "Events Evolved," in which he dives deeply into the [YUI 3 Event system](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/event/) (created by Adam Moore, one of YUI's architects). YUI 3's Event module is one of the strengths of the library, and Luke's talk is the best job we've done so far of talking about its best qualities. This is must-see-tv for YUIers.

More video from YUICONF will be on [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) in the coming weeks; I hope you enjoy this first installment.
