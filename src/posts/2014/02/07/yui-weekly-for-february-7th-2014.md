_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community._

## Release News

Work continues on [Sprint 12](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule), which is slated to release on February 25th. You can track the commits as they land on the [`dev-3.x`](https://github.com/yui/yui3/commits/dev-3.x) and [`dev-master`](https://github.com/yui/yui3/commits/dev-3.x) branches.

## Open Roundtable

This week's [Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9BQta07N_A) featured another episode of _YUI In The Wild_. This week, [Pat Cavit](https://twitter.com/tivac) from [ArenaNet](http://www.arena.net/) joined us to talk about how they use YUI for their [websites](http://www.guildwars2.com/) and in-game user-interfaces.

Pat touched on a bunch of tools that are used in ArenaNet, such a NodeJS-powered task runner called [Dullard](http://github.com/tivac/dullard), and a YUI meta-data extractor called [Configgur](https://github.com/tivac/yui-configger). He also showed a bunch of modules and [extensions](https://github.com/tivac/yui-viewparent) on top of YUI. Check out the [entire video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9BQta07N_A) and browse [Pat's GitHub](http://github.com/tivac/) to find the repositories that was referenced.
