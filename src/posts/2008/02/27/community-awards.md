At the YUI 2nd Birthday Party last night in Sunnyvale, we acknowledged several members of the YUI Community who, through their work on the community forums or elsewhere, have made outsized contributions to the YUI project by assisting fellow developers around the world. Because this kind of community-building and support is an act of generosity that makes the world a smaller place, we chose to acknowledge the fabulous work of the five recipients with gift certificates to [Kiva.org](http://kiva.org/), a website that enables person-to-person microlending around the world.

Here are the recipients of the first annual round of YUI Community Awards.

### Satyam

[![Satyam's award slide during the 2nd Birthday celebration.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/satyam-award.jpg)](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/msearch?date=any&DM=------------&DD=----&DY=----&DM2=------------&DD2=----&DY2=----&AM=contains&AT=satyam&SM=contains&ST=&MM=contains&MT=&charset=UTF-8)

For being the bedrock of the YUI community; for always having the right answer and the generosity to write it down; for being more productive in "retirement" than most of us ever are before retirement. (And let's not forget the contributions to documentation, the terrific blog articles on DataTable, and the wise counsel on projects in the pipeline.)

### Caridy Patiño Mayea

For the [Bubbling Library](http://bubbling-library.com/) and the help it's provided to its users; for being able to answer questions about any YUI component (even really _hard_ questions); for writing great examples and contributing to the YUIBlog. _Bienvenidos a Miami, Caridy!_

### Jing Ceawlin

For being there with a Chinese translation on the spur of the moment; for being a voice of wisdom and reason on the community forum; for your versatility, insight and thoughtfulness in helping YUI developers discover the power of the library in their projects.

### Satyen Desai
