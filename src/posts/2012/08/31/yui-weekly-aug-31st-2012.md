-   Big week around YUI HQ as we wrapped up our latest work and pushed [3.7.0pr1](https://github.com/yui/yui3/tree/v3.7.0pr1) to the CDN. You can read all about the changes and improvements in the latest [blog post](/yuiblog/blog/2012/08/31/yui-3-7-0pr1-event-performance/). ScrollView received a major update this release, so here's a [detailed overview](https://gist.github.com/3522590) of all the changes and additions. Happy upgrade testing!
    
-   If you want to learn more about our awesome new build tool [Shifter](https://github.com/yui/shifter), and new CLI tool [Yogi](https://github.com/yui/yogi), check out [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4ozoej5y08) from this week's Open Hours with Dav Glass.
    
-   Ryan Grove's [Y.Template pull request](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/230) generated quite a bit of discussion about templating in YUI. You can watch Ryan & Eric's Hangout discussing it in more detail, [part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO2xCmnY53g) & [part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLZ3AGD5d1w). That looked like a tasty sandwich!
    
-   On the topic of templating, [mustache-wax](https://github.com/zillow/mustache-wax) is a utility to wrap precompiled Mustache templates (using Handlebars) in YUI modules.
    
-   Jay Shirley wrote an article on building [Better (Authenticated) Single Page Applications](http://tech.tdp.me/2012/08/28/better-applications/) by using YUI.
    
-   Jeff Pihach threw together [a useful monkey-patch](http://fromanegg.com/post/30091877117/adding-a-validation-fail-event-to-yuis-y-attribute) to demonstrate how to add a ValidationFail event to [Y.Attribute](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/attribute/).
    
-   [jsPlumb](http://jsplumb.org) is a neat [open-source](https://github.com/sporritt/jsplumb/) flowchart builder available for YUI.
    
-   New/Updated modules in the [Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) this week: [gallery-md-model](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/md-model), [gallery-yui3treeview-ng](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/yui3treeview-ng), [gallery-paginator-view](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/paginator-view), [gallery-zui-rascroll](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/zui-rascroll), [gallery-zui-attribute](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/zui-attribute), [gallery-datatable-paginator](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datatable-paginator), [gallery-zui-scrollsnapper](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/zui-scrollsnapper), [gallery-model-sync-local](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/model-sync-local)
