-   **[YUI in Use at Playground-focused Non-profit KaBOOM.org](http://kaboom.org/):** Elliot Laster, web developer at [KaBOOM](http://kaboom.org/), [wrote in](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1398&p=4472#p4472) to tell us about the work his team is doing with YUI 2.  YUI 2 is used throughout the site, as is jQuery, and is used extensively in the projects section, where you can learn about the playground projects that that KaBOOM is tracking in your area ([like this one in San Francisco's Guerrero Park](http://projects.kaboom.org/project_searches?state=CA&x=13&y=12)). KaBOOM is "a national non-profit dedicated to bringing play back into the lives of our children. We passionately believe that play has purpose. We are driven to create a movement in support of this belief." ([Original source.](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1398&p=4472#p4472))

-   **[Anthony Super's Row Grouping for YUI DataTable](http://antscode.blogspot.com/2009/08/row-grouping-for-yui-data-table.html):** We missed this in August when he released it, but [Anthony Super has a row-grouping add-on for YUI DataTable](http://ogspot.com/2009/08/row-grouping-for-yui-data-table.html) that others in the forums have picked up on.  If row grouping is a feature you've been looking for, it's worth checking out. Mark Mansour has a video up of how he's using this functionality on his own site:

-   **[Andrew Wooldridge — YUI 3 Gallery is Prometheus for JS Developers](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2009/11/04/yui-library-gallery-prometheus-for-javascript-developers/):** [Writes Andrew](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2009/11/04/yui-library-gallery-prometheus-for-javascript-developers/): "Just like Prometheus brought fire down from the heavens for mankind, [the YUI team has made it possible for you to harness the power of YUI](/yuiblog/blog/2009/11/04/introducing-the-yui-3-gallery/) as well as become a part of the YUI 'family' yourself. If you build some set of code using YUI, you can have it show up on the gallery. Nothing special right? Well, if you jump through a few other hoops (clone their repo on github, and agree to their licensing) you can have your own lib code served through their CDN. Yes, you heard that right, the same CDN that Yahoo uses to push code out to their edge servers to make it fast and 'local' to the machines and browsers that need it will be hosting your code as well. You might also someday get a 'golden ticket; and be allowed to be part of YUI itself. This is a pretty unprecedented level of openness in a js library."  Read his full post [here](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2009/11/04/yui-library-gallery-prometheus-for-javascript-developers/).

-   **[LA Public Library Using YUI](http://catalog.lapl.org/carlweb/jsp/DoSearch?databaseID=965&index=W&terms=temeraire):** Stoyan noted recently that the Los Angeles Public Library is [using YUI on its book details page](http://catalog.lapl.org/carlweb/jsp/DoSearch?databaseID=965&index=W&terms=temeraire), using Adam Moore's [TreeView Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/) to expose information about which branches have copies of a book in circulation and whether those copies are available or checked out.

Developer Network has [a great summary of Caridy Patiño Mayea's talk on YUI 3 custom modules](http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/10/event_bubbling.html) from YUICONF 2009.

-   **[Philip Tellis's Review of Matt Snider's Storage Utility Talk at #YUICONF](http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/11/matt_snider_yui.html):** Philip Tellis [journaled Matt Snider's talk from YUICONF](http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/11/matt_snider_yui.html) on the Yahoo! Developer Network blog.  Writes Philip: "The first thing that struck me during the talk was how easy it is to use this utility. The storage utility allows web developers to store far more data on the client side than is possible through the use of cookies and it cleanly abstracts out the details of the specific storage engine used. It currently supports HTML5, Google Gears, and Flash storage engines, but is easily extensible to handle more engines in future."
