						<div class="entry">
							<p><a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=continuity ' title='signing into Buzz'><img src='http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/continuity.png' alt='Signing into Buzz' /></a></p>
<p>Just recently I published a new pattern, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=continuity">Sign-in Continuity</a>, to the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Yahoo! Design Pattern Library</a>. It could be filed under &#8220;Engagement,&#8221; a category we have internally but that hasn&#8217;t appeared yet here, but I decided to put it in the &#8220;Social&#8221; category instead.</p>
<p>The pattern is about making sure that a user&#8217;s momentum isn&#8217;t robbed when they want to participate in a community and have to be challenged for their login credentials in order to sign their contribution. The crux of the pattern is to preserve context and make sure the user is inconvenienced as minimally as possible so that the <em>continuity</em> of the experience is preserved.</p>
<p>This raises a legitimate question: What&#8217;s &#8220;social&#8221; about sign-in? I have two reasons for classifying this pattern that way. </p>
<p>One is that signing-in is an act of claiming one&#8217;s identity in a shared space. Identity is an important social pattern &#8220;parent&#8221; and we have a number of patterns related to identity in the works.</p>
<p>The other is that social sites have evolved some new engagement patterns (some positive, some negative) having to do with invitation, sharing, organic growth, and levels of involvement, and in this context signing in to participate plays a role.</p>
<p>This was, by the way, what we like to call a &#8220;peeve-driven&#8221; pattern. I was trying to comment on a social object at Yahoo! site. (I won&#8217;t say which one because the problem has since been fixed.) I was challenged to sign in, which was fine, but once I presented my credentials, I was returned to the site&#8217;s home page instead of to the comment box I had been working on. Oh noes!</p>
<p>Sometimes, a poor user experience can help us identify an antipattern (in this case, sign-in </em>dis</em>continuity or in the original Latin, <em>participatio interruptus</em>) &mdash; and then the antipattern points the way to the positive solution.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to mention that my summer intern, <a href="http://blog.chrishanrath.com/">Chris Hanrath</a>, completed this pattern and prepared it for publication. Chris also spent a lot of the summer working on the pattern library site redesign that I can&#8217;t wait to unveil. Stay tuned!</p>

						<div class="entry">
							<p> As a JavaScript toolkit developer, there are two features lacking in Opera that have frustrated me for a while: support for the <code>contextmenu</code> DOM event and the ability to override the default rendering of focus via CSS.  When Opera released version 9.5, I was disappointed to see that neither of these features were implemented. As frontend engineers, we spend a lot of time responding to decisions made by browser manufacturers, but we don&#8217;t get much opportunity to learn the specific thought process behind those decisions. After exchanging some emails with the Opera team, I now have some insight into their decisions and the perspective that perhaps withholding such features could be beneficial to the user.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p> Although the capabilities of the browser have evolved significantly in recent years, the user&#8217;s perception of the browser hasn&#8217;t necessarily evolved with it.  After the launch of Yahoo! Photos 3.0, I remember a friend of mine emailing me because she was having trouble viewing the large version of her photos.  She was repeatedly clicking on each thumbnail without success.  Eventually she figured out that she needed to double click on the thumbnails to view the full size image.  Double clicking to open a folder or a file is, of course, a natural interaction on the desktop, but for years users were trained not to expect this interaction in the context of web applications. </p>
<p> Some users still don&#8217;t expect desktop-like interaction from web applications.  I remember logging into my Yahoo! Mail not long ago and seeing checkboxes next to each message.  I paused.  What were these checkboxes, these artifacts of Web 1.0, doing in my Web 2.0 application?  I had been using the new DHTML, Outlook-like version of Yahoo! Mail since its early beta and had become used to dragging and dropping in order to move and delete messages.  But the reappearance of these checkboxes was another sign that not every user&#8217;s expectations had evolved with the capabilities of the browser. </p>
<p> As the browser has matured it has evolved it into a platform for rich application development, making it possible to deliver applications with a level of interactivity and visual fidelity of those found on the desktop.  And while the browser is now a platform, it also continues to play its original Web 1.0 role of an application, a content viewer that enables users to surf all of the news sites, blogs, etc. scattered across the eclectic Web.  But as the browser now plays these dual roles of being an application and an application development and delivery platform, how does this duality impact the user in terms of usability and accessibility?  And what user-centric features and functionality can consumers expect of a browser, especially one battling with duality?  I suspect that Opera&#8217;s answer to these questions is that not all users understand the modern browser&#8217;s dual role, and that is it necessary to render some fundamental things consistently across experiences within the browser. </p>
<h3>Context Menus</h3>
<p> <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/menu/contextmenu_source.html"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/klootsopera/contextmenu.gif" alt="The YUI Menu Control's ContextMenu in Safari (top) and Opera (bottom); Opera does not allow developers to customize the context menu in web applications." width="280" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right"></a></p>
<p>Consider context menu functionality. By not implementing the <code>contextmenu</code> event, Opera does not allow frontend engineers to override the<br />
default context menu provided by the browser; all other <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/">A-Grade browsers</a> support this feature. What benefit could there be to not implementing the <code>contextmenu</code> event?</p>
<p>If some users  perceive everything inside the scope of the browser as a web page, that influences the user&#8217;s expectation of what functionality will be surfaced in a context menu.  Over the years many users have come to expect that raising a context menu in the scope of a browser will surface browser-centric functionality relative to HTML content (i.e. &#8220;Open Link in New Window&#8221;), rather than functionality of the web application running within the browser.  Therefore, providing a custom context menu for a web application might not be expected or seen as helpful for users who have come to rely on functionality in the browser&#8217;s context menu.</p>
<p>The downside is that, by not allowing the developer to provide custom context menu implementations (such as those provided by the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/">YUI Menu Control</a>), Opera is in a small way preventing the user from understanding the browser as a platform for rich application development. </p>
<h3>Focus</h3>
<p>Focus could be considered as sacred as the context menu. Knowing what element has focus is fundamental to keyboard accessibility. And while most modern browsers support customization of the rendering of focus, is it a good idea to do so?  The presentation and behavior is of HTML is now so completely customizable via CSS and JavaScript that the user experience can differ drastically across sites and applications on the web.  Keeping something as fundamental as focus consistent means one less thing the user has to re-learn when navigating the across the web.  Consider the following example: </p>
<h4><a href="/sandbox/yui/v252/examples/button/example10.html#example-1">Example 1: Anchor Elements (The Good)</a></h4>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/klootsopera/anchor.png" height="25" width="51" alt="Screen capture of a focused anchor in Opera 9.5 for Mac"></td>
<td>Focused anchor in Opera 9.5 (Mac)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/klootsopera/link-button.png" height="34" width="69" alt="Screen capture of a focused anchor styled as a button in Opera 9.5 for Mac"></td>
<td>Focused anchor styled as a button in Opera 9.5 (Mac)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> This example illustrates how the focused state of an anchor element is rendered consistently in Opera regardless of how it is styled.  This consistency can be considered helpful to the user in that the familiarity of the focus outline conveys the element&#8217;s role.  Therefore, the user knows what to expect when the element is clicked regardless of how it is styled.  However, as illustrated in the following example, this benefit breaks down a little as the focus model for buttons isn&#8217;t the same as it is for anchor elements.</p>
<h4><a href="/sandbox/yui/v252/examples/button/example10.html#example-2">Example 2: Buttons (The Bad)</a></h4>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/klootsopera/button-1.png" height="24" width="69" alt="Screen capture of a focused button in Opera 9.5 for Mac"></td>
<td>Focused, unstyled button in Opera 9.5 (Mac)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/klootsopera/button-2.png" height="26" width="70" alt="Screen capture of a focused, styled button in Opera 9.5 for Mac"></td>
<td>Focused, styled button in Opera 9.5 (Mac)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> This example illustrates a potential flaw in Opera&#8217;s rendering of focus in version 9.5: unlike anchor elements, unstyled and styled buttons get two different renderings of focus, both of which are completely different, and different from the focus style applied to anchor elements.  So, in Opera 9.5 there are three different focus implementations for the user to learn: the system default, the Wii-style focus and the dotted border.  Compare Opera&#8217;s focus implementation to that of Safari or Internet Explorer, where by default focus is rendered consistently across elements of various types. </p>

<p> Since the default implementation of focus can be customized in other browsers, perhaps Opera users still fair better since learning Opera&#8217;s three, fixed focus models is ultimately better than having to learn potentially infinitely more.  That said, if Opera is going to prevent customization of focus in the interest of usability and accessibility, they could further improve the user experience by providing a consistent implementation of focus across elements. As it stands in Opera 9.5, the following mixed styles can appear together, presenting a  confusing set of visual cues:</p>
<h4><a href="/sandbox/yui/v252/examples/button/example10.html#example-3">Example 3: Mixed types together (The Ugly)</a></h4>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/klootsopera/link-button.png" height="34" width="69" alt="Screen capture of a focused anchor styled as a button in Opera 9.5 for Mac"></td>
<td>Focused anchor styled as a button in Opera 9.5 (Mac)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/klootsopera/button-4.png" height="26" width="70" alt="Screen capture of a focused, styled button in Opera 9.5 for Mac"></td>
<td>Focused, styled button in Opera 9.5 (Mac)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> As illustrated by the first and second examples, Opera has three different, yet fixed implementations of focus.  While Opera&#8217;s implementation of focus can be considered good insofar as the user only has a limited number of focus models to learn, it might also be considered bad in that it makes it harder to provide a consistent user experience within a single site or web application.  For example, if you wanted to place an anchor and button next to each other in a toolbar, but style them consistently so that they both look like buttons, each would still render focus differently in Opera, leaving the user to wonder how the difference is significant. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> In Opera designers and developers lose a degree of customization, but the user gains a slightly more consistent browsing experience. In some ways this consistency benefits the user in that fundamental interactions like focus and context menus remain the same regardless of the site or web application in use.  However, by limiting certain types of customization designers and developers will find it just a bit harder to provide a consistent user experience within their site or application and to train the user to expect more from Web 2.0. </p>

							<p><a href='/yuiblog/blog/2008/06/10/patterns-for-designing-a-reputation-system/reputation-patterns/' rel='attachment wp-att-213' title='Reputation patterns'><img src='http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/rep-patterns.jpg' alt='Reputation patterns' border='0' /></a></p>
<p>Recently, we released a family of related <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/parent.php?pattern=reputation">Reputation patterns</a> to the Yahoo Design Pattern Library, the first of several collections of social-design related patterns that we&#8217;re working on. These patterns are somewhat different from the typical UI or rich-interaction type of pattern. They don&#8217;t tell you how to lay out a page or where to put an interactive widget. Instead, they address how to design a reputation system for your social software.</p>
<p>A key element in the Reputation family of patterns is one we call <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=competitive">The Competitive Spectrum</a>:</p>
<p><a href='/yuiblog/blog/2008/06/10/patterns-for-designing-a-reputation-system/competitive-spectrum-2/' rel='attachment wp-att-215' title='Competitive Spectrum'><img src='http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/competitive-spectrum1.jpg' alt='Competitive Spectrum' /></a></p>
<p>The Competitive Spectrum is the first pattern you should look at because it asks you to consider the degree of <em>competitiveness</em> in the community you are trying to build or foster. Are you aiming for a highly cooperative community, an arena for death-matches, or something in between? The answer to that question will inform which of the remaining Reputation patterns best apply to the design of your site or application.</p>
<p>The primary author of these patterns (and the creator of the sensitizing images) is <a href="http://soldierant.net/archives/2008/06/patterns_of_reputati.html">Bryce Glass</a>, a senior interaction designer on the Y! OS social team. Product manager Yvonne French deserves some of the credit as well. The patterns were developed for an internal reputation platform here at Yahoo! that was inspired and guided by online community guru <a href="http://www.fudco.com/habitat/archives/000076.html">Randy Farmer</a>. We&#8217;re very pleased to be able to share them with the wider web community now and as always we welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I forgot to mention that Bryce gave a great talk about reputation design at the IA Summit this year: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/soldierant/designing-your-reputation-system/">Designing Your Reputation System (in 10 Easy Steps)</a>.</p>

<p>Charts are a great idea to make rows and rows of boring numbers easier to understand and to take in &mdash; for people that can see them. However, not all of your site&#8217;s visitors can see and you&#8217;ll also want to keep information you offer available for search engines. There are a lot of libraries on the web that allow you to create charts, but not many take this use case into consideration.</p>
<h2>In praise of data tables</h2>
<p>This is where data tables come into play. (<strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this article, I&#8217;m referring to pure HTML tables &mdash; not to rich UI controls like Jenny Han Donnelly&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">YUI DataTable Control</a>.)  They are the perfect data construct in HTML as they are  available both for people that can see and those who can&#8217;t. Assistive technologies like screen readers offer a way to navigate tables and to read their information row-by-row and cell-by-cell. All you need to do to please everyone is to use the correct markup (including a few attributes you might not have used yet):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table summary=&quot;Results of a survey of which animals people would like to see more on YDN&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;What animals would you like to see more?&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Requests&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Kittens&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;45331&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Puppies&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;32323&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Elephants&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;12345&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Badgers&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6546&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sharks (without lasers)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;223&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sharks (with lasers)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2323&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>summary</code> attribute tells assistive technology what this table is about and the <code>caption</code> shows up for all users. The <code>th</code> elements define what cells are headers and the <code>scope</code> attribute applies them to all the data cells they are connected to. In this case it means that &#8220;animal&#8221; gets read out before each animal and &#8220;requests&#8221; before each number. This means that even a visitor who cannot see will still know in row five what the information is about. All in all the table renders as:</p>
<table summary="Results of a survey of which animals people would like to see more on YDN">
<caption>What animals would you like to see more?</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Animal</th>
<th scope="col">Requests</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Kittens</td>
<td>45331</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Puppies</td>
<td>32323</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elephants</td>
<td>12345</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Badgers</td>
<td>6546</td>

<tr>
<td>Sharks (without lasers)</td>
<td>223</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sharks (with lasers)</td>
<td>2323</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Easy to understand, but not too pretty. And it can get boring.  How about we use this information and create a tasty pie chart like the following (click on the image below to see the working example in action)?</p>
<p><a href="/assets/charttable/chartsexample.html"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/charttable/chart-table.png" alt="The accessible table enhanced with a pie chart (image; click through to see working example)" width="414" height="536" border="0"></a></p>
<h2>Using table data to automatically generate charts</h2>
<p>In order to have the table be preceeded by a pie chart like this all you need is to add two scripts at the end of the document body and a class called <code>yui-table</code> to the table itself. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class=&quot;yui-table&quot; summary=&quot;Results of a survey of what browser people love&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;What browser do you love?&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Browser&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Lovers&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;MSIE&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;221&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Firefox&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;516&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Opera&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;312&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Safari&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Omniweb&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Lynx&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.1/build/yuiloader/yuiloader-beta-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;tablestoyuicharts.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This will show in a browser with the latest Flash plugin like this:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/charttable/chartsexample.html"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/charttable/chart-table2.png" alt="The accessible table enhanced with a pie chart (image; click through to see working example)" width="414" height="527" border="0"></a></p>
<p>You can define the size of the chart in CSS by defining a width and height for each div element with a class of <code>yuichartfromtable</code>:</p>
<pre><code>div.yuichartfromtable{
  width:300px;
  height:300px;
  margin:0 auto;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As for the scripts: the first script is the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/loader">YUI Loader Utility</a> which allows you to pull in YUI components on-demand. This is great, as you don&#8217;t need to add lots and lots of <code>script</code> elements but let the YUI Loader figure out what it needs. You can <a href="/assets/charttable/tablestoyuicharts.js">download the second script here</a>; if you care to know what is going on with it, check the following section. If you just want to use the script, then you&#8217;re done :-).</p>
<h2>How does this work?</h2>
<p>The script to turn all tables with the class <code>yui-table</code> into charts is quite short, as it uses the newer YUI components that take a lot of the heavy lifting off you, especially the table-to-dataset conversion which is done by the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datasource">YUI DataSource Utility</a>. The full script is this:</p>
<pre><code>
var tablestoYUIchartsplease = new YAHOO.util.YUILoader({
  require: ['charts'],
  onSuccess: function(){
    var tables = YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('yui-table','table');
    YAHOO.util.Dom.batch(tables,function(o){
      var chartcontainer = document.createElement('div');
      YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass(chartcontainer,'yuichartfromtable');
      YAHOO.util.Dom.insertBefore(chartcontainer,o);
      var data = new YAHOO.util.DataSource(o);
      data.responseType = YAHOO.util.DataSource.TYPE_HTMLTABLE;
      data.responseSchema = {fields:['response','count']};
      YAHOO.widget.Chart.SWFURL = 'http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/build/charts/assets/charts.swf?_yuiversion=2.4.1';
      var chart = new YAHOO.widget.PieChart(chartcontainer,data,{
        categoryField:'response',
        dataField:'count',
        expressInstall:'http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/build/charts/assets/expressinstall.swf'
      });
    });
  }
});
if(document.location.toString().indexOf('http')!==-1){
  tablestoYUIchartsplease.insert();
}</code></pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s chunk it up and see what each section does:</p>
<pre><code>var tablestoYUIchartsplease = new YAHOO.util.YUILoader({
  require: ['charts'],
  onSuccess: function(){
</code></pre>
<p>First up, we let the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/loader">YUI Loader</a> do its magic: We instantiate a new loader, tell it we need the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts">YUI Charts Control</a> and wait for the different script nodes to be generated and the components to be loaded before we continue. The loader tells us all is OK by firing the <code>onSuccess</code> event, which we use to execute an anonymous function that does all the other work.</p>
<pre><code>    var tables = YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('yui-table','table');
    YAHOO.util.Dom.batch(tables,function(o){
</code></pre>
<p>We use <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom">the YUI Dom Collection</a> to get all tables with the correct class and apply a function to each of these tables using the <code>batch</code> method. The method sends the current table as the parameter <code>o</code> to this function.</p>
<pre><code>      var chartcontainer = document.createElement('div');
      YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass(chartcontainer,'yuichartfromtable');
      YAHOO.util.Dom.insertBefore(chartcontainer,o);
</code></pre>
<p>We create a new <code>div</code> element, give it a class of <code>yuichartfromtable</code> (to allow for styling) and insert the new element into the document before the table.</p>
<pre><code>      var data = new YAHOO.util.DataSource(o);
      data.responseType = YAHOO.util.DataSource.TYPE_HTMLTABLE;
      data.responseSchema = {fields:['response','count']};
</code></pre>
<p>Then we allow the rather new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datasource">YUI DataSource Utility</a>  to flex its binary muscles. While this is meant to wade through external data sources and JavaScript arrays for you, it also allows for a <code>responseType</code> of HTML table, which means it converts a table to a JavaScript object you can work with. As we&#8217;re dealing here with a really simple table, all we need to do in terms of <code>responseSchema</code> is to define two fields: a <code>response</code> (what) and a <code>count</code> (how many). These three lines are all you need to convert the table to a dataset that both the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts">YUI Charts Control</a> and the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable">YUI DataTable Control</a> can use.</p>
<pre><code>      YAHOO.widget.Chart.SWFURL = 'http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/build/charts/assets/charts.swf?_yuiversion=2.4.1';
      var chart = new YAHOO.widget.PieChart(chartcontainer,data,{
        categoryField:'response',
        dataField:'count',
        expressInstall:'http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/build/charts/assets/expressinstall.swf'
      });
</code></pre>
<p>Time for pie: we define the URL of the Flash movie that draws the pie and instantiate a new pie chart. We send the <code>div</code> we created earlier as the container, the <code>data</code> we retrieved from the table as the data to display and define a configuration object. This object has the <code>response</code> field as the categories and the <code>count</code> field as the data. The <code>expressinstall</code> defines what Flash movie to show if the visitor doesn&#8217;t have the right Flash version.</p>
<pre><code>    });
  }
});
if(document.location.toString().indexOf('http')!==-1){
  tablestoYUIchartsplease.insert();
}</code></pre>
<p>Almost done. All the script now needs to do is to call the <code>insert()</code> method of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/">YUI Loader</a> &mdash; that gets the ball rolling. I&#8217;ve enclosed the method in an <code>if</code> statement that checks if the HTML is called up via HTTP or not as the Charts Control needs HTTP to work.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s all you need to do to progressively enhance an accessible data table to turn them into a pie chart using the YUI Charts Control. We can extend this example to allow for several types of charts and to turn the tables into sortable data tables quite easily. If there is interest, drop us a comment.</p>

						<h2 id="post-159"><a href="/yuiblog/blog/2008/01/15/carousel-pattern/">Carousel Design Pattern</a></h2>
					

						<div class="entry">
							<p><a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=carousel'><img src='http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/3d-carousel.thumbnail.jpg' alt='3-D carousel wireframe image' align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"></a>As the end of last year was winding up I spent some time tinkering with the open pattern library, in order to clear the way for our latest pattern release, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=carousel">Carousel</a>. One reason why I needed to do this tinkering is that the Carousel pattern contains a few new fields in its data model. These are primarily elements that we have been including lately in our internal patterns that I wanted to find a way to promote to the public library.</p>
<p>But first, a little bit about the pattern. Folks inside and outside of Yahoo! have been asking us for a carousel patterns since before I got here (and you all want carousel code from YUI too &mdash; <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/23851">we hear you</a>). It&#8217;s been possible to make a carousel using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=slide">Slide Transition</a> pattern and associated YUI code, as Bill Scott <a href="http://billwscott.com/carousel/">demonstrated</a> quite some time ago, but the detailed do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of effective carousels were still left up to the individual developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=carousel"><img src="http://yuiblog.com/assets/carousel-pattern.png" width="300" height="294" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="The Carousel Pattern page on the Pattern Library site"></a>Internally here at Yahoo! we had a several partial carousel guidelines (carousels are used extensively across the network, especially in the Media Group sites) but no consistent standard. This past summer a large number of user experience designers carried on a week-long discussion &mdash; sharing experience and insights &mdash; and hashed out the major issues involved with carousel design. After that I gathered a group of interested designers and developers and started shaping those comments into a sketchy pattern draft.</p>
<p><a href="/yuiblog/blog/2007/10/02/challenges-of-interface-design-for-mobile-devices/">Lucas Pettinati</a>, a designer on the YDN team who also works closely with YUI, devoted a lot of time to sorting out the subtle details and possible variations on the basic carousel theme with me, and also cooked up some basic wireframe diagrams to help illustrate the possibilities. The draft pattern made its way through several review cycles and finally emerged ready to publish near the end of last year.</p>
<p>Why so much effort? It&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s certainly possible to describe a carousel in pattern format in a lot fewer words than we did. Both <a href="http://welie.com/patterns/showPattern.php?patternID=carrousel">Patterns in Interaction Design</a> and <a href="http://ui-patterns.com/pattern/Carousel">UI-patterns.com</a> manage to describe carousels in fairly simple terms (the latter even uses a Yahoo! carousel as its sensitizing example). </p>
<p>We felt that there were more subtle issues at work here than simply queuing up a bunch of images and allowing them to scroll into a viewport. You&#8217;ll be the judge of whether we were right, and as always we welcome feedback on the pattern.</p>
<p>One last note about the pattern format: I&#8217;ve added a new field, Special Cases, to the pattern format. We&#8217;ve used it internally for some time and I&#8217;m not sure why we haven&#8217;t used it in the open library. In the past that material sometimes made it into the solution or rationale or was left out. As with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=votetopromote">Vote to Promote</a> I&#8217;ve also included a Pattern Gallery and have now made that a standard element in the pattern model.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve added a few new headings to the links along the gutter of the pattern description: Other Examples, Wireframe Templates, and Similar Patterns in Other Libraries. Other Examples are examples from around the Web, outside of the Yahoo! network. Wireframe templates are downloadable stencils (currently in Omnigraffle and Visio XML format) that designers can use to create and position their carousels. Similar Patterns in Other Libraries are, well&#8230; need I explain?</p>
<p>Inside Yahoo! our designers always want stencils to work with just as our developers always want code. We are working on producing wireframe templates for all of our patterns, starting with the new ones. You&#8217;ll notice that we don&#8217;t yet have YUI code for the carousel pattern but as soon as we do I will of course add a link to it from the pattern entry.</p>
<p>So I spent the holidays tinkering with the JSON and PHP files that build the library and adding in the new fields without breaking all the old patterns. (OK, I broke them but then I fixed them but that&#8217;s what staging servers are for, right?) Now that the new year has rolled around I realized I had stealth-released the carousel pattern when I should really be shouting about the newest pattern to the rafters. A lot of people have worked hard on this and I&#8217;m proud of the result. I hope you find it useful. Let us know what you think.</p>

						<h2 id="post-150"><a href="/yuiblog/blog/2007/12/07/pattern-library-brown-bag/">An inside look at the Pattern Library</a></h2>
					

						<div class="entry">
							<p>As the third curator of Yahoo!&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Design Pattern Library</a> I often receive a lot of thanks and praise from website designers and developers for the way we at Yahoo! have offered this resource to the world. I usually try to explain that much of the goodness happened before I came on board and that I can&#8217;t really take credit for it, but when my ego needs a boost I just smile and nod.</p>
<p>When Erin Malone and Matt Leacock and others first launched the internal pattern library, they presented a talk at the IA Summit, called <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/implementing_a_pattern_library_in_the_real_world_a_yahoo_case_study">Implementing a Pattern Library in the Real World: A Case Study</a> (and subsequently the linked article on the same topic at Boxes and Arrows). Then Erin and Bill Scott took the library to the public on the Yahoo! Developer Network website and Bill Scott <strike>&#8220;</strike><em>enriched</em><strike>&#8220;</strike> the library with tons of Ajax-y goodness, closely tied to the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui">YUI Library</a>.</p>
<p>Since that time, I came on board and I&#8217;ve worked on reorganizing the library, updating the patterns, and shepherding a new generation of patterns through our internal refinement and review process, with an eye toward identifying useful social and openness patterns that we can share with the whole Web. So when people come up to me at conferences or find me on mailing lists for <a href="http://iainstitute.org/">information architects</a> and <a href="http://gamma.ixda.org/topics.php?topic=patterns">interaction designers</a> frequently they are curious about how the library has evolved in the years since it was founded, what our internal process looks like these days for writing, reviewing, approving, and rating patterns, and how we decide which ones to publish in the open library.</p>
<p>Recently, I gave a talk here at Yahoo! as part of our UED brown-bag series, called <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blogs/theater/archives/2007/12/ued_pattern_library_w_christian_crumlish.html">The Pattern Library Wants YOU!</a>, intended to update oldtimers on changes and improvements to our process and infrastructure and to orient new designers about the library, and of course to encourage people to get involved. Ricky Montalvo, our ace videographer for <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/">YUI Theater</a> and YDN Theater, recorded my talk and edited it together with my slides, and we just spent a week or so removing any too-sensitive information and getting our friendly legal folks to sign off on releasing the talk to the public.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here is the public version of my talk, which should answer a lot of those questions I&#8217;m hearing these days.</p>
