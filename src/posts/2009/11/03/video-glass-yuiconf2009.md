[Dav Glass](http://blog.davglass.com/) ([@davglass](http://twitter.com/davglass)) is well known to the YUI community as the creator of the [YUI Rich Text Editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/), [Layout Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/layout/), [Resize Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/resize/), [ImageCropper](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imagecropper/), and much more. His [trove of YUI examples](http://blog.davglass.com/2006/06/yui-code-samples/) has helped thousands of developers fine tune their own YUI implementations.

Dav's focus lately has been on [YUILibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com/), our community platform. YUILibrary.com includes our project tracking, bug repositories, and [forums](http://yuilibrary.com/forum) ([documentation](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) and [examples](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/) are still hosted by our friends at the [Yahoo! Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.com/)). Last week, we debuted another facet of YUILibrary.com: [the YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/). Dav covers a wide range of developer/community issues in his YUICONF 2009 session, "[Contributing to YUI](ttp://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=glass-yuiconf2009-contributing)," charting the progress we've made in the past year opening the project up to contributions and in making YUI 3 as extensible as possible.
