We've started a new week and it's time for a new YUIConf 2013 video. Today we have a great talk from [Caridy Patiño](https://twitter.com/caridy) entitled "[Introducing the 'Modown' Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1ADXKyvHU0)". This one has been asked about quite a bit on IRC and offers a great introduction to [Modown](https://npmjs.org/search?q=modown). If you missed [last Friday's video](/yuiblog/2014/01/24/yuiconf-2013-talk-eduardo-lundgren-on-reintroducing-alloyui/), or you'd like to catch up, check out the [YouTube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKP9DUCzZorde6sLWHJ3GNd-6VrGrbqm).
