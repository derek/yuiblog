### YUIDoc Updates and Travis CI Integration

With the [latest release of YUIDoc](/yuiblog/blog/2012/05/09/yuidoc-0-3-0-is-official/) and his recent [post on getting YUI tests running on Travis CI](/yuiblog/blog/2012/05/11/yui-and-travis-sitting-in-a-git-tree/), it seems like a good time to have a chat and Q&A with Dav. Not that there's a bad time to have a chat with Dav.

### Time & Details

We'll be online on **Thursday from 10am to 11am PDT**.

We're going back to using Adobe Connect this week because the broadcast resolution from Google+ Hangouts on Air was a bit low, and we'd like the chat to be more accessible for non-IRC users. Let us know if you agree or disagree in the comments.

### Recording

The recording is [available in the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25SVekBdeR0&hd=1).
