It is slightly less flexible than other CSS frameworks like 960 and Blueprint, but because of this, it is also more enjoyable to use as there is less to learn. I find the markup to be more semantic with YUI than the other CSS frameworks as well, so thats a large plus in my book." <a href="#yuiBlogWild-505">#</a><br /><a href="http://www.flintstudio.com/blog/some-great-web-development-applications-and-frameworks/"><img src="/blog-archive/assets/flintstudio-20100901-231541.jpg" vspace="10" /></a><li id="yuiBlogWild-506"><strong><a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/the-quick-easy-way-of-getting-into-yui-simpleyui">Ajaxian's @reybango on SimpleYUI, Coming in 3.2.0</a>:</strong> Rey introduces SimpleYUI this way: "The Yahoo! YUI is an incredibly feature-rich JavaScript library with a LOT of functionality but getting your head around all of those features can be tough. The YUI team wants to help developers get up and running more quickly and announced yesterday the release of SimpleYUI; a basic and more streamlined version of the YUI library." SimpleYUI is a rollup of common, core modules in the library, with the added twist that it self-instantiates -- making it a little simpler and more accessible for those new to YUI. <a href="http://ericmiraglia.com/yui/demos/quickyui.php">You can read more about SimpleYUI here</a>. <a href="#yuiBlogWild-506">#</a><br /><a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/the-quick-easy-way-of-getting-into-yui-simpleyui"><img src="/blog-archive/assets/simpleyuionajaxian-20100903-091505.jpg" vspace="10" /></a><li id="yuiBlogWild-507"><a href="http://codeinfront.com/2010/09/simpleyui-makes-yui-easy-to-use/"><img align="right" hspace="10" src="/blog-archive/assets/codeinfront-simpleyui-20100904-093735.jpg" vspace="5" /></a><strong><a href="http://codeinfront.com/2010/09/simpleyui-makes-yui-easy-to-use/">"SimpleYUI Makes YUI Easy to Use," by @codeinfront</a>:</strong> Australian developer <a href="http://codeinfront.com/2010/09/simpleyui-makes-yui-easy-to-use/">@codeinfront had this to say</a> about the <a href="/blog-archive/blog/2010/09/03/coming-inyui-3-2-0-simpleyui/">SimpleYUI implementation in YU1 3.2.0</a>: "YUI 3 is a powerful CSS and JavaScript framework including low-level DOM utilities and high-level user-interface widgets designed to make front end application development simpler and more robust.

Native apps have, in a sense, spoiled users; with things like drag-and-drop and basic touch gesture recognition almost laughably simple to implement in native apps, web app developers are left to hack in such features themselves or risk having their app seem dated from the get-go. Today Yahoo! is looking to make things a bit less painful with the latest release of their open-source User Interface library, YUI." <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/09/07/yahoos-user-interface-library-learns-to-love-being-touched-gestured-at/">You can read the full article here</a>. <a href="#yuiBlogWild-509">#</a><br /><a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/09/07/yahoos-user-interface-library-learns-to-love-being-touched-gestured-at/"><img src="/blog-archive/assets/mobilecrunch-yui320-20100907-210308.jpg" vspace="10" /></a><li id="yuiBlogWild-510"><strong><a href="http://carlos.bueno.org/2010/04/sweet-justice.html">Sweet Justice, a Text Justification Plugin for YUI 3 from Carlos Bueno</a>:</strong> Writes Carlos: "<a href="http://github.com/aristus/sweet-justice">Sweet Justice</a> is a Javascript library you can drop onto any web page to create beautiful justified text.

Alex Hall took an existing one and built on it: "I really needed a nice little star rating system with <acronym title="Yahoo User Interface">YUI</acronym> for this blog...and after a single search in <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=star rating yui">Google</a> I found Ville Saavuori's <a href="http://www.unessa.net/en/hoyci/projects/yui-star-rating/" title="YUI Star Rating Script By Ville Saavuori">Star Rating Script for YUI</a>, which is perfect for the job I needed... However, for a new project I am undertaking I realised that his implementation was not going to work for multiple rating systems on the same page because it is based on ID's, and as we all know, you can only have one ID reference in the DOM on one page. So I started to rework the script to allow for more rating systems on a single page using classes instead of ID's." Alex's <a href="http://www.devseo.co.uk/examples/rating-example/">example page</a> is here. <a href="#yuiBlogWild-511">#</a><br /><a href="http://www.devseo.co.uk/blog/view/star-rating-script-with-yui"><img src="/blog-archive/assets/starratings-20100911-114504.jpg" vspace="10" /></a><li id="yuiBlogWild-515"><strong><a href="http://www.devseo.co.uk/blog/view/yuilight-spotlight-your-page-elements-with-yui">Alex Hall's YUILight Spotlighting Widget for YUI 2</a>:</strong> Writes Alex: "YUILight is a customisable YUI Script that will highlight an element on your page simply by applying a class of 'yuilight' to that element. When that element is clicked and focused on, everything else on the page will be covered by a mask and that single element will stand out from the rest. It is a very simple script to implement only requiring two javascript files and no CSS! The options for customising the script can be found at the top of the javascript file (which is fully commented for you). At the moment you can change the generic background colour (when no background colour has been specified for the element). This option is so that your element doesn't disappear with the text. You can also configure the opacity of the mask element and the animation speed that it shows and hides. I will be adding more customisable fields later on but if you have any requests please feel free to leave them in the comments section at the bottom of this post."
