We wrap up [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) coverage of [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009) with a talk from Todd Kloots ([@toddkloots](http://twitter.com/toddkloots)) on the accessibility features of [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/): "[Building Accessible Widgets with YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=kloots-yuiconf2009-a11y)." Todd covers YUI's support for keyboard handling, focus styling and management, ARIA roles and states, and much more.
