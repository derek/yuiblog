Thanks to the dozens of contributors who have submitted hundreds of commits [over the past month](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pulse/monthly). With Sprint 10 will beginning next week, expect an update to the [development schedule wiki](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule) soon.
    
-   A big YUI welcome to Ezequiel Rodriguez who joins the team this week! Stay tuned to for a more formal introduction here on the blog, but in the meantime you can find him on Github as [@ezequiel](https://github.com/ezequiel) and Twitter at [@ziggyism](https://twitter.com/ziggyism).
    
-   At this week’s [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable), discussion topics included [data binding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binding) in YUI, [Models](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/model/) and [ModelLists](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/model-list/), [Promise](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/promise) control flow, nested [Views](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/view/), and [ES6 modules](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules). You can find a video [over on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nUvywbwCKo).
    
-   Recent threads on the [contributor mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/yui-contrib) include [a Git tip](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/B1n050KE1SY) to help out with the [new release workflow](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Developer-Workflow#merging-fixes-into-a-release-branch), and continued discussion on [Button improvements](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/yui-contrib/NroWMOr-51g).
    
-   [SmugMug Map](https://github.com/smugmug/yui-gallery/tree/master/src/sm-map) is _"an ordered map data structure with an interface and behavior similar to (but not exactly the same as) [ECMAScript 6 Maps](http://people.mozilla.org/%7Ejorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-15.14)."_ Coming soon to a [YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) near you! Speaking of the Gallery, there was no deploy this week due to a few technical glitches. We hope to have those resolved for next week's deployment.
