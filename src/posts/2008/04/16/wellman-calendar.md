[We mentioned Dan Wellman's new book](/yuiblog/blog/2008/04/10/wellman-yui-book/) the other day, _[Learning the Yahoo! User Interface Library](http://www.packtpub.com/yahoo!-user-interface-library-yui/)_, and provided [a PDF of the chapter on the YUI Connection Manager](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/pdf/wellman-connectionmanager.pdf). The publisher, Packt, has put up [another sample chapter on its own site](http://www.packtpub.com/article/implementing-calendar-control-yahoo-user-interface) — one that goes into great depth on the [YUI Calendar Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/). If you're working with the YUI Calendar in your own app, or if you're thinking about it, this chapter provides an excellent foundation.
