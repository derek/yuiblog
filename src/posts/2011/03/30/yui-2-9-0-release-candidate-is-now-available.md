The YUI 2.9.0 release candidate is now available for review by the community. The team will be taking the next few days to do a final round of testing, so we'd like to encourage our developer community to get any feeback to us by the end of the week.

The release candidate, YUI 2.9.0 PR4, is available both via the [CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.9.0pr4/build/yahoo/yahoo.js) as well as a [downloadable package](http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/download.php?file=77bc92d6e12a65e3a8797031e19fa307) for testing. Please [provide feedback](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui2/newticket?version=2.9.0%20PR4) by Friday, April 1 on any bugs and regressions you may find.
