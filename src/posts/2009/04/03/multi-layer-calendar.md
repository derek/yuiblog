[![John Peloquin's multi-layer calendar navigator.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/calendar-layer-20090403-152423.jpg)](http://blogs.whardy.com/john/2009/04/03/multi-layer-calendar/)

YUI contributor (and author of the [Interval Selection Calendar example](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/calendar/intervalcal.html)) John Peloquin of W. Hardy Interactive has released another excellent option for [Calendar](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/) implementers: [a layered navigation path for selecting years and months](http://blogs.whardy.com/john/2009/04/03/multi-layer-calendar/). The layered approach provides an alternative to the built-in [navigator interface](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/calendar/calnavigator.html) that ships with Calendar.

John describes the inspiration and thought process behind this implementation [on his blog](http://blogs.whardy.com/john/2009/04/03/multi-layer-calendar/), where you'll also find [API documentation](http://whardy.com/js/yui/multilayercalendar/docs/YAHOO.WHII.widget.MultiLayerCalendar.html "Multi-Layer Calendar API documentation") and [source code](http://whardy.com/js/yui/multilayercalendar/docs/multilayercalendar.js.html "Multi-Layer Calendar source code").
