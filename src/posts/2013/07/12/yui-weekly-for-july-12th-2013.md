_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

_Note: Due to the July 4th holiday, this post is a combination of the previous two weeks._

-   Now back from vacation, the team and community have been hard at work finishing up the next release of YUI. The release window is targeted to open up July 16th (next Tuesday) and barring any complications, will result in the release of **YUI 3.11.0**. To get a peak at what has changed, here's the [v3.10.3...dev-3.x compare](https://github.com/yui/yui3/compare/v3.10.3...dev-3.x). To summarize, it includes 551 commits from 19 authors and will include updates to [Attribute](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/attribute/), [Base](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/base), [Calendar](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/calendar), [Charts](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/charts), [Datatable](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/datatable), [Paginator](https://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/paginator), and more, Thanks to all the contributors and testers who helped make this next release happen!
