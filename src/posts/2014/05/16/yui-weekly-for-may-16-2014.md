_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community._

## Release News

### YUI

We'll be shipping YUI 3.17.0 next week! [Sprint 14](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule) has ended and we'll be doing a last round of checks on Monday before deploying the release branch. If all goes well, YUI 3.17.0 will be out on Tuesday morning!

### Pure

We're planning on shipping Pure 0.5.0 this week as well. We've had the [Pure 0.5.0 Release Candidate 1](http://stage.purecss.io) out for a while now and haven't noticed any regressions so we'll be going ahead with the 0.5.0 GA release. Stay tuned by following us on the [Pure Blog](http://blog.purecss.io).

## YUI Open Roundtable

We didn't have any guests for this week's Open Roundtable, but I wanted to give a shout out to [Pete Hunt](https://twitter.com/floydophone), who joined us on the Open Roundtable last week to talk about [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org). Check out the video below:
