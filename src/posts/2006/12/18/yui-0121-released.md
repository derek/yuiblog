Version 0.12.1 of [the Yahoo User Interface Library (YUI)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) was released this morning. This minor update focuses on bugs and issues raised since 0.12.0; no new features are introduced in this release.

Among the improvements you'll notice in 0.12.1 include significant performance boosts for [Slider](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/) when used in Firefox, particularly when the Slider's DOM elements are deeply nested in the DOM.
