### Implementation focus: [Photo Pairs](http://eglinetwork.ch/pairs)

[Marco Egli](http://twitter.com/marcoegli) is the lead developer for [Elstr](http://www.elstr.com/) services in Switzerland. As a break from the [daily grind](http://demo.elstr.com/), he decided to get his hands dirty with the latest technology, and created a simple memory game called Photo Pairs.[![Photo Pairs memory game, powered by YUI 3](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Photo-Pairs.jpg)](http://eglinetwork.ch/pairs)

In his own words:

> With the photo pairs project I wanted to get familiar with the latest and greatest in web technology. So I decided to create the backend with [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and use on frontend HTML5 semantics and CSS3 styles. Because I am quite experienced in using the YUI2 library (for Elstr and the [infinite crossword](http://infinitecrossword.net/)) the new site was ideal to experiment with YUI3. All the pairs games I found in the www were built with predefined images. But I wanted to give a wider variety of possibilities to the user. So it was an obvious decision to use Flickr as a photo source.

The site is using YQL, Tabview, Overlay, Anim, and DataType. Join us to look under the hood.
