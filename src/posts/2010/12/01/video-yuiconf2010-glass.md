[![YUI engineer Dav Glass speaks at YUIConf 2010 at Yahoo! HQ in Sunnyvale, CA.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf2010-glass-20101124-131708.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-glass)

Dav Glass ([@davglass](http://twitter.com/davglass)) has been at the vanguard of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "node.js") experimentation and evangelism for awhile, and this is the second [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/ "YUI Theater") talk in which he explores the key value propositions of Node in terms of sharing code between client and server. We had a number of Node.js-themed talks at [YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/ "YUIConf 2010") (including a visit from Node.js creator Ryan Dahl, who gave [a talk on the Node.js roadmap](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-dahl "Video: Ryan Dahl — Node.js Roadmap (YUI Theater)") and appeared on a special [panel discussion on the future of frontend engineering](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-panel "Video: Dion Almaer, Ben Galbraith, Elaine Wherry, Thomas Sha, Joe Hewitt, Ryan Dahl, Tantek Çelik, and Douglas Crockford — YUIConf 2010 Panel Discussion: The Future of Frontend Engineering (YUI Theater)")). Dav's work, however, is the best starting place if you're wondering what the fuss over server-side JavaScript is about and why this development dovetails with the core tenants of the discipline.
