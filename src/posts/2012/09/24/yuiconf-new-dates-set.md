You can finally update your calendars, as we have the new dates for YUIConf this year. YUIConf will be held on **Nov 14–15** (Wed. and Thurs.) at the **[Santa Clara Marriott](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sjcga-santa-clara-marriott/).** Thank you all for your patience as we wanted to adjust the dates to account for conflicts with the previous times. Feel free to set up your travel plans and we will be sending additional information on registration and hotel information in a forthcoming blog post.
