# Open Roundtable

In this week's [Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4w3e-JRXy0), [Eric](http://twitter.com/ericf) and I joined [Andrew](https://twitter.com/triptych), [Clarence](https://twitter.com/clarler) and [Juan](https://twitter.com/juandopazo) to discuss the work that we've been doing to make CSS easier and more enjoyable to write.

If you haven't seen [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4w3e-JRXy0), you're missing out because I live-coded a responsive layout from scratch using the new mobile-first grid system that we've been working on.

Here are some of the tools that we mentioned in the talk:

-   [`rework-pure-grids`](github.com/ericf/rework-pure-grids): A Rework plugin to create mobile-first responsive grids.
-   [`grunt-stripmq`](https://github.com/jtangelder/grunt-stripmq/): A Grunt plugin that makes sure your mobile-first layouts still look great in old browsers that don't support media queries.
-   [`css-mediaquery`](https://github.com/ericf/css-mediaquery): A media query parser, written in JS.
-   [`grunt-css-selectors`](https://github.com/ericf/grunt-css-selectors): A Grunt plugin that lets you mutate CSS selectors within your CSS file. This is how YUI consumes Pure, but we’ve generalized it to work with any CSS input.

Stay tuned for more information as we finalize our story around responsive web design.
