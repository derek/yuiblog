Cory Mintz from [Phanfare](http://phanfare.com/) wrote in last week to tell us about their recent product launch, which is heavily based on YUI 2.8.0.

> We just released our new web organizer yesterday... It is a full photo and video organizer built as a web application, using just about every YUI 2 component. We think it really blurs the line between desktop and web software.
> 
> Some notable features are:
> 
> -   Using the [Uploader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader/), we let people organize and edit their photos as they upload.
> -   With the help of [Drag and Drop](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/ "YUI Library") and [Menu](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/ "YUI Library"), the thumbnail grid has all of the behaviors of an OS’s file browser. You can drag select, drag and drop reorder, multi-select using ctrl and shift, arrow between thumbnails, etc.
> -   The dynamic loading of the [TreeView](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/ "YUI Library"), let us lazy load user accounts with 100s of albums since they are hierarchical ( year -> album -> section ). This allows the page for an extremely large account to load just as fast as a small account.

I love the clean professionalism of the site and the extraordinary attention to detail in the UI. Feel free to tour the site -- trial accounts are free and come populated with sample albums to give you a feel for what the site has to offer. Congratulations to Cory and the team for such a fantastic launch.
