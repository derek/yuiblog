One of the great benefits of developing YUI in the open is that everyone is free to contribute in a way that highlights their own talents. One such talented person is Kevin Lamping. Kevin takes Khan Academy style training to the next level with his first YUI tutorial video that introduces new developers to the [use()](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/YUI.html#method_use "YUI use method") and [add()](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/YUI.html#method_add "YUI add method") methods. He uses clear and concise language to convey the basics of YUI and demonstrates not only how to include core modules into YUI but how to create new ones as well. Even if you are a YUI veteran you will enjoy the conversational style and lively presentation!

![Kevin Lamping](/yuiblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/lamping2.jpg)_**About the contributor:** I am a Front-end Web Developer born and raised in the Texas Hill Country, and I'm currently living in San Antonio with my wife and two-year old son (pictured). I've been using YUI professionally for over three years and last year migrated to YUI 3 as my primary framework. This video was born out of a desire to help newcomers to YUI 3 understand how modules are created and loaded. Since learning the ins-and-outs of YUI 3, there are many things I know now that I wish I knew back then. Hopefully this screencast can prove to be a good reference for those just beginning with YUI 3._
