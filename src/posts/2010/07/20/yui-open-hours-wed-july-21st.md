For those of you that don't subscribe to the [YUI calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/calendar/#calendar) or [YUILibrary.com forum](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/), the next installment of [YUI: Open Hours](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/08/introducing-yui-open-hours/) will be tomorrow, July 21st.

This time we're going to focus on a recurring theme for YUI community contributors that are just getting started building their own modules: How to build a Widget and how to build a Plugin in a YUI 3 way.

Anthony Pipkin, aka apipkin of #yui IRC channel fame, will be the guest, guiding us through his learnings over the last year and showing how to move from copying and pasting the YUI 3 documentation examples to feeling confident that you're making the right choices for how to approach a problem in a "YUI 3 way of thinking".

We'll take a look at two of his simpler Gallery modules, the [Button Widget](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/button) and the [Node IO Plugin](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/plugin-node-io). He'll discuss what they looked like originally, versus today, and why they changed.

Then we'll play around a while, maybe build something from scratch based on what the folks on the call want to cover.

Matt Sweeney (Node, Selector, TabView, Grids, etc) and Satyen "the Guru" Desai (Widget, Plugin, Base, Attribute, etc) from the YUI team will also be on the call. So there will be best practices in the house.

For YUI 3 consumers that aren't (yet?) contributors, this call should still be valuable for understanding the thinking behind how YUI 3 widgets and plugins are built and what sort of patterns to expect from new YUI components. And no doubt there will be other great takeaways as always.

We'll be online from 10am to 12pm PDT. The connection details are the same as usual.

Here's the [forum thread](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=4167) for this Open Hours. I'll post some of the interesting takeaways after the call.
