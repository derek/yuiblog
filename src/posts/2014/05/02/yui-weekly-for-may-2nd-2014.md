_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community._

## Release News

Work is ongoing on [Sprint 14](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule), which is slated to culminate in a YUI release on May 22nd. We have a lot of open pull requests from the community which we'll be reviewing and merging in over the next few days!

## YUI Open Roundtable

Since I missed a few YUI Weekly's, we have to do some catching-up on the Open Roundtable updates! In case you've been out of the loop, here's what's been happening:

### Learning Paths with Andrew Wooldridge

Our very own awesome community engineer, [Andrew](http://twitter.com/triptych), showed off the Learning Paths that he's been developing. It's a great way for folks to understand YUI in meaningful steps.

### Using Promises in Mojito with Marco Asbreuk

Marco dropped by for a great _YUI In The Wild_ episode, where he talked about how to implement promises in a Mojito application. Lots of code shown in this Roundtable, and a must-watch if you use [Mojito](https://github.com/yahoo/mojito).

### The Modown Project by Eric Ferraiuolo and Caridy Patino

Finally, last week, [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericf) and [Caridy](https://twitter.com/caridy) talked about the Modown Project, which is something that we've been working very hard on over the last few months. Modown is a set of components that take care of hard problems related to the web-stack so developers can focus on making apps.

Sorry for the lengthy hiatus guys! We're back on schedule now, so stay tuned for another YUI Weekly this Friday!
