### What's coming in YUI 3.4.0?

We're trying to get our ducks in a row earlier nowadays, and add a little more transparency to our development cycle and process. Believe it or not, we actually have some idea of what we plan to release in version 3.4.0.

The final version 3.4.0 is scheduled for an August release, but we'll be posting three incremental Preview Releases on the way there, including the first, PR1, this week!

Join the call for an overview of some of the upcoming features and bug fixes, get a status on where we are today, and get a first glance into our new release cycle.

### Time & Details

We'll be online from **10am to 11am PDT Thursday**. The connection details are the same as usual.
