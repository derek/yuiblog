The YUI Team just released [version 2.5.0 of the library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/). We've added six new components — [Layout Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/layout/), [Uploader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader/) (multi-file upload engine combining Flash and JavaScript), [Resize Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/resize/), [ImageCropper](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imagecropper/), [Cookie Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/cookie/) and a [ProfilerViewer Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/profilerviewer/) that works in tandem with the YUI [Profiler](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/profiler/). This release also contains major improvements to the [DataTable Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/) and new [Dual-Thumb Slider functionality](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/#dual) in the Slider Control. Here are the highlights:

-   **DataTable Control:** Jenny Han Donnelly has been joined by Luke Smith for this development cycle, and we're all thrilled with what they've produced. [DataTable in 2.5.0](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/) gets a more robust markup structure that allows greater control over all aspects of the table. This release also includes major performance enhancements, improvements to the fixed-header implementation for vertical scrolling, built-in support for horizontal scrollling, an all-new Paginator class, support for drag-and-drop column reordering, and a new set of column APIs with hooks for showing, hiding, adding and removing columns.

    DataTable has been one of YUI's most popular and important components since its debut, and this is its strongest release yet. If you have existing DataTable implementations that you want to upgrade, take a look at the [new User's Guide](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/), as it has some detailed notes about API changes. The [DataTable examples roster](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/) is another nice place to check out the new code in action.
-   [![The YUI Layout Manager](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/layout_small.png)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/layout/)**Layout Manager:** Dav Glass has a lot for you to enjoy in 2.5.0, but top billing goes to his new [Layout Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/layout/). Layout Manager eases development of multipane UIs that take up either the full viewport or the full canvas of any block-level element. Layout Units within a layout are resizeable, collapsible, removable and swappable; transitions between expanded and collapsed states have built-in animation support. Whether you're creating a full-screen application like Yahoo! Mail or a rich multi-pane pop-up, Layout Manager is a great place to start.
-   **Uploader:** If you've ever built a UI for uploading files via a browser, you know what the big pain points are: One file at a time, no easy way to track upload progress, no programmatic access to file metadata, etc. The new YUI [Uploader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader/) addresses these issues and others, allowing for the creation of more powerful, intuitive, and responsive file upload experiences. Allen Rabinovich of the [ASTRA Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/flash/astra-flash/) team did the legwork on this one, and it's the same code that underlies the Flickr Uploader. Uploader is our second JavaScript/Flash hybrid control (following on the heels of the [Charts Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/) in 2.4.0).

-   **Resize Utility:** Layout Manager is built upon a new YUI utility, [Resize](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/resize/). Dav's Resize Utility formalizes the support that YUI [Drag & Drop](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/) has long provided in example form and makes it easier for you to make any block-level element resizeable. Resizing can be implemented directly (the resized element resizes in real time during the interaction) or by proxy (a proxy element visualizes the interaction until its conclusion, at which time the resized element snaps to its new size).
-   [![The YUI ImageCropper Control](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/imagecropper.png)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imagecropper/)**ImageCropper Control:** The Resize Utility makes a lot of things easier — and one of those is the implementation of an [ImageCropper](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imagecropper/) interface, which Dav built out on top of Resize for 2.5.0. Take a look at [the examples](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/imagecropper/) and be sure to check out the support Dav provided for modifier keys in this very desktop-like UI control.
-   **Cookie Utility:** When he's not busy writing books or working on My Yahoo!, Nicholas C. Zakas is cranking out new code for YUI. In 2.5.0, he contributes [the Cookie Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/cookie/), a simple but powerful component that helps you get maximum mileage out of your limited cookie space. Because browsers limit the number of cookies you can set per domain (and because that limitation can sneak up on you if you manage a large site with many subdomains), the Cookie Utility supports "sub-cookies." Sub-cookies pack multiple name-value pairs under the umbrella of a single cookie, expanding the number of data points that you can store in cookie space.
-   **ProfilerViewer Control:** 2.4.0 saw the release of Nicholas's [Profiler](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/profiler/), a headless, cross-browser kit for profiling JavaScript functions. To make it easier to access and interpret the data that Profiler collects, we've added a [ProfilerViewer Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/profilerviewer/) in 2.5.0 that sits on top of Profiler and visulizes its accrued data. ProfilerViewer leverages the Charts Control and the DataTable Control. Taken together, Profiler and ProfilerViewer provide another arrow in the development quiver that includes tools like Firebug's integrated profiling interface.

-   [![The YUI Slider Control now has dual-thumb support.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/dualthumbslider.png)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/#dual)**Slider Control with Dual Thumb Support:** Supporting [dual-thumb interactions in our Slider Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/#dual) has been on our list for awhile, and Luke took the opportunity to get this out to you in 2.5.0. Sliders are "finite range controls"; dual-thumb sliders allow you specify a sub-range within the control's larger range. The classic use case for dual-thumb sliders is on shopping sites, where such controls can allow users to filter results based on price range. Check out the [User's Guide](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/#dual), [example](http://ydn.corp.yahoo.com/yui/examples/slider/slider_dual_with_highlight.html), and the [new Slider Cheatsheet](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/pdf/cheatsheets/slider.pdf) (which has a second page dedicated to dual-thumb implementations).
-   We're using this release to promote the following components from beta to GA status: [ColorPicker Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/colorpicker/), [Get Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/) (for cross-domain, dynamic loading of [script](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/get/get-script-basic.html) and [CSS](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/get/get-css-basic.html) files), [JSON Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/json/), [ImageLoader Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imageloader/), and [YUI Test Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/). These promotions reflect the maturity of those components and their very low bug traffic. As always, we're releasing all new-for-2.5.0 components under the beta moniker, and we're looking forward to your feedback on those once you get a chance to try them out.
-   Full details on the release, including a rollup of the changelog for all components and a bug/feature manifest, are available in [Georgiann Puckett's update to the YUI developer forum this morning](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/25780).

### One More Thing...

YUI now ships with [more than 270 examples](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/), many of which are accompanied by full tutorials to help you get started using YUI. And while individual examples are good, we've gotten a number of requests to create an über example, one that pulls in and makes use of a wide range of YUI components in a single sample application — while still being YUI-centric and not littered with noisy implementation logic.

The incomparably prolific Dav Glass rose to the challenge for 2.5.0 with [a complex, multi-component example](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/layout/adv_layout_source.html) that uses [Layout Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/layout/) as its basis and Yahoo Mail as its inspiration.

### Let's Celebrate!

We're excited to get 2.5.0 out the door and, as luck would have it, we've got a fantastic excuse to celebrate. YUI's (and the [Yahoo Pattern Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/)'s) second anniversary party is coming up next week (February 26, 5 p.m., Sunnyvale), and we'd love to have you join us. [Sign up on Upcoming to let us know you'll be stopping by](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/415087) at Yahoo! HQ for some beer and general revelry. We look forward to showing off some of the stuff you all have been doing with YUI in the past two years and we'll talk a bit about where Patterns and YUI are headed from here.
