In February 2008, the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) and the [Yahoo Pattern Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/) turn two years old.

In those short two years, YUI has grown into a richly featured library that embodies some of the best of what HTML, CSS and JavaScript make possible in the browser. With a light, fast core, YUI empowers you to build your own solutions that support all [A-Grade Browsers](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/). And when you want to pull additional functionality off the shelf, YUI is there for you with more than 30 a la carte components that range in complexity from a simple [JSON Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/json/) to the powerful [DataTable](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/), [Menu](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/) and [Rich Text Editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/). When big established brands like CBS Marketwatch, Southwest Airlines, Northwest Airlines, IndyCar.com, and others join Yahoo in [implementing YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/poweredby/), you know you've got a library with traction, momentum, and critical mass. And when you see young companies like [Gaia Online](/yuiblog/blog/2007/09/25/gaia/), [Mint](/yuiblog/blog/2007/12/05/mint/), and [OurStory](/yuiblog/blog/2007/02/08/implementation-focus-ourstorycom/) building the future of their business with YUI at the foundation, you know what motivates us to keep improving the library every day.

The [Yahoo Pattern Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ypatterns/) is the outgrowth of a long history of work at Yahoo and elsewhere. Bill Scott, now at NetFlix, took the Pattern Library "open" alongside YUI back in 2005, and it's now under the stewardship of Christian Crumlish. But the library really draws from the creativity, inspiration, and effort of the full community of user-experience specialists at Yahoo, as well as from those of you in the community who work with Christian to improve upon and iterate the patterns. Christian is hard at work burnishing the existing patterns and creating new ones, and 2008 looks like another great year for this resource.

## Celebrate!

We'd like to invite the Yahoo Pattern Library and YUI Library communities to Yahoo for a modest birthday celebration on February 26, 2008, beginning at 5 p.m. on the main Yahoo campus in Sunnyvale. We've opened up registration for 150 guests on Upcoming, and signups will be on a first-come first-served basis. Registration is required due to limited space in our venue, [so please sign up right away if you want to reserve yourself a spot](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/415087/).

Christian will give a short talk on the YPattern Library at 5:30 and the YUI Team will be updating you on plans for the coming year after that. Beer and some food will be served, and we're looking forward to a mellow evening with lots of opportunities to mingle, share ideas, and hear what you all are up to.
