[![Tor Norbye and James Gosling show YUI support in the new NetBeans release; queue to 8:30 of the video.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/gosling.png)](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/media_shell.jsp?id=FRdamp267672)

[Jason Lee](http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/) wrote in with this tip:

> In a general session with James Gosling at JavaOne last week, Tor "NetBeans Guy" Norbye demoed the really nice JavaScript support that was just added to NetBeans (code completion, browser-compatibility warnings, syntax highlighting, refactoring, etc). He did so using YUI, and NetBeans did a very nice job with the code complete, etc. Really slick demo...

[Sun has video of the session](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/media_shell.jsp?id=FRdamp267672); I recommend [downloading the mp4 file](http://sun.edgeboss.net/download/sun/08d01555/08d01555_82.mp4) and queuing to 8:30 for the NetBeans section, where Norbye shows how easy it is to instantiate a [YUI Rich Text Editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/) using the new NetBeans JavaScript support.
