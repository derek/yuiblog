The next installment of YUI: Open Hours will be next Wednesday, the 29th.

YUI 3 Charts are coming in the next release, and a preview of some early work is already [in the Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/). Tripp Bridges will be on the call, introducing the new structure and showing how the learnings from YUI 2's Charts package informed the new architecture, seeking that fine balance between flexibility and simplicity. Oh, and did I mention **no Flash**?

Also on deck will be [Allen Rabinovich](http://twitter.com/allenr) giving an update on the amazing work he's been doing on the yuilibrary.com redesign. We're talking everything, here: home page, user guides, demos, tutorials, API docs. The works. In many ways it's a whole new story, and a much better one.

We'll be online from 10am to 12pm PDT. The connection details are the same as usual.

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (Skype works great for non-US participants\*)
2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953#
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

And finally, the yuilibrary.com forum thread for this Open Hours is [here](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=5031). Look there for notes, interesting takeaways, and the recording of the call after it's done. Or start the conversation off early by posting questions, suggestions for topics, or code that you'd like review.

Don't forget to subscribe to the [YUI Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/calendar/#calendar) and follow [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) on Twitter for the latest updates on Open Hours and other YUI interestingness.

Hope to see you there!
