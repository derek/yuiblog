[![The cover of Dan Wellman's new book on the YUI Library.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/wellman250.gif)](http://www.packtpub.com/yahoo!-user-interface-library-yui/)As we mentioned in [a recent "In the Wild" post](/yuiblog/blog/2008/03/05/in-the-wild-20080305/), the first book dedicated solely to [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) has hit the shelves: Dan Wellman's _[Learning the Yahoo! User Interface Library](http://www.packtpub.com/yahoo!-user-interface-library-yui/)_ from Packt Publishing.

Dan takes on a broad subset of topics in this volume. Dan and the team at Packt were kind enough to let us [share a sample chapter with you here](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/pdf/wellman-connectionmanager.pdf) to give you a sense of Dan's approach to YUI — an approach that emphasizes clear explanations, practical examples, and lots of sample code. In this sample, Dan explores Thomas Sha's [YUI Connection Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/) (our wrapper for XHR/Ajax) and shows you how to build both a News Reader application and Login application. This should give you a good flavor for what the remainder of the book holds:

-   **"[Ajax and Connection Manager](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/pdf/wellman-connectionmanager.pdf)"**, by Dan Wellman; from _Learning the Yahoo! User Interface Library_ pp. 103-126.

-   Get inside Event Handling with YUI
-   Create consistent web pages using YUI CSS tools
-   Work with Containers—implementation, skinning, adding transitions, and tabs
-   Debug, maintain, and update applications with the Logger control
-   Examples included in the book:

We've got our first few copies going around here among the YUI development team and it's been a great pleasure to see the care and thought Dan and Packt put into the volume. The book can be ordered [directly from Packt](http://www.packtpub.com/yahoo!-user-interface-library-yui/book) in bound or e-book form. It's also [available from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Yahoo-User-Interface-library/dp/1847192327/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207845837&sr=8-1).
