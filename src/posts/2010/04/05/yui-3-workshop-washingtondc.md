We're excited to be hosting a half-day hands-on [YUI 3 workshop](http://ydnworkshop-dc.eventbrite.com/) later this month in Washington, DC, featuring YUI contributor Gonzalo Cordero and YUI Architect Adam Moore. Join us for a 3-hour session where you'll learn all the ins and outs of using the latest generation of Yahoo!'s open-source library that is taking the front-end engineering world by storm.

This workshop is free and open to the public, but it might just be the perfect way to kick off your JSConf weekend. Spaces are limited, so be sure to get all the details and reserve your spot at [Eventbrite](http://ydnworkshop-dc.eventbrite.com/).

[JSConf](http://jsconf.us/2010/) attendees are also invited to attend Adam and Gonzalo's "Track B" sessions that Sunday, April 18. At 10:30 AM Adam will be discussing event-driven application design in his _Interesting Moments - Working with the YUI 3 Event System_ session, and Gonzalo demonstrates how easy and quick it is to start building extensible robust and scalable modules using YUI3 in _YUI3 - Creating modules using YUI_ at 2:30 PM.

Hope to see you there!
