[Joe Hewitt](http://www.joehewitt.com "Joe Hewitt's Blog"), a longtime Mozilla/Firefox engineer and the author of DOM Inspector, recently made a return to frontend development after many years working on browser code. He found that the state of the art in terms of tooling hadn't advanced much since his days as a DHTML author in the late 1990s.

While many frontend engineers have lamented the state of debugging tools in the JavaScript development arena, Joe reacted in a singularly useful fashion: He set about in January 2006 to create a Firefox extension that brought together some of the great strengths of Venkman and DOM Inspector in an integrated, lightweight interface. Adding features inspired by sources ranging from Python to Prototype, he's been evolving FireBug for the past five months and developing a cult following of developers who are finding FireBug to be an essential part of their toolkit.

Joe stopped by Yahoo! last week to talk to the Y! frontend engineering community about FireBug. He was kind enough to let us capture the talk on video, and we're pleased to share the core part of his talk with you here. We apologize for the poor audio quality, which does not do full justice to the quality of Joe's presentation, but we wanted to help get the message out about FireBug.
