We are pleased to announce the availability of YUI 3.5.1 on [CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.5.1/build/yui/yui-min.js) or as a [download](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.5.1.zip). YUI 3.5.1 is a smaller scoped release of [bug fixes](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/125) only.

Enjoy!
