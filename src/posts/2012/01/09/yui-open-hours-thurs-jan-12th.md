### YUI 3.5.0 Button (and more?) update

Welcome to 2012! We're starting this year off easy, talking about buttons. `Y.Button`s to be exact. [Derek Gathright](http://twitter.com/derek) will be joining us to give the latest details on the classes and modules for creating YUI style buttons, what's available today and where, what's coming up, and reviewing some of the unique challenges of creating something as simple as a button.

If we have time in the hour, we might talk about DataTable's development status as well, since that's consuming most of my time and attention these days.

### Time & Details

We'll be online on **Thursday from 10am to 11am PST**.

### Recording update

There were technical complications this week (aka, Luke's lack of AV skills), and the recording wasn't salvageable. Derek was kind enough to share his talking points, with links, in this gist: https://gist.github.com/1599415.
