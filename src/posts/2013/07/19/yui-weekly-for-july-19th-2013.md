_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   This week saw the release of **YUI 3.11** and conclusion of [Sprint 8](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#sprint-8-3110). In this release, performance improvements to [Attribute](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/attribute) and [Base](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/base) continue, where we're now seeing a 500% speed improvement in some [Base performance tests](https://github.com/yui/yui3/tree/master/src/base/tests/perf/)! In addition to performance enhancements, this release saw the introduction of [Paginator](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/paginator/), [DataTable Paginator](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/DataTable.Paginator.html), as well as other enhancements and bug fixes. You can find all the details for this release in the [YUI 3.11 release announcement](/yuiblog/blog/2013/07/16/yui-3-11-0-released/) for more details.
    
-   The team also released **Pure 0.2.1**. While there are no new features in this patch release, Pure's contributors have been hard at work closing [16 issues](https://github.com/yui/pure/issues?milestone=5&page=1&state=closed) and providing additional enhancements to the library. For more details on this release, check out the [Pure v0.2.1 announcement](https://github.com/yui/pure/releases/tag/v0.2.1).
    
-   To conclude what appears to have been "Release Week" for the YUI community, **Yeti 0.2.24** landed earlier today. Yeti is the tool that drives all of YUI's automated testing, and this release introduced official support for IE 6 & 7, improvements to browser launching, added integration with other testing tools, and quite a bit more. Check out the [release announcement](/yuiblog/blog/2013/07/19/yeti-0-2-24-released/) for a full recap.
    
-   Blog posts this week featured a [recap](/yuiblog/blog/2013/07/16/velocity-2013-building-a-faster-and-stronger-web/) of [Velocity Conference 2013](http://velocityconf.com/). If you are a developer interested in high-performance & high-scale web applications, you'll definitely want to check out the post, watch some of the videos linked to, and take a peek at some of the slide decks. Incredibly valuable information was shared at an all-around great conference.
    
-   At this week’s [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable), discussion topics included [YUI 3.11](/yuiblog/blog/2013/07/16/yui-3-11-0-released/), [Pure 0.2.1](/yuiblog/blog/2013/07/18/pure-0-2-1-released/), Github's [Releases feature](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software), highlights from Velocity, and an update on [@patjameson](http://twitter.com/patjameson)'s [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/) project. You can find a video of that Hangout [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GZPLhoupAk). At next week's Roundtable, Anthony Pipkin ([@apipkin](https://twitter.com/apipkin)) will be talking about the recently released [Paginator](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/paginator/) component.
