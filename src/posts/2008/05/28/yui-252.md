[![Visit the YUI web site, where you can download YUI or learn more about the libaries 30+ components that make rich internet application development easier for professionals.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuilib.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/)The YUI development team released version 2.5.2 today; you can [download the new release from SourceForge](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/) or [configure your implementation using the YUI Configurator](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/#configure). This is a focused release that addresses several key bugs while providing support for Firefox 3 and Opera 9.5, both of which are expected to reach GA this summer. Key points for YUI 2.5.2:

-   **Anticipating Opera and Firefox updates:** When [Firefox 3](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html) and [Opera 9.5](http://www.opera.com/products/desktop/next/) go GA this summer, they will be [A-Grade browsers](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/), and we wanted to make sure that we anticipated those debuts with a release that was validated against the latest betas available. YUI 2.5.2 was tested against Opera 9.5b2 and Firefox 3.0RC1. In both cases, the new browsers look terrific, and this YUI release incorporates several changes that will help users make the upgrade seamlessly.
-   **Major bug fixes:** [DataTable](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/), [Menu](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/), [Rich Text Editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/) and [Button](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/button/) are the key beneficiaries of bug fixes in 2.5.2, but dozens of fixes are provided throughout the library. [Check out George Puckett's release rollup in the YUI Community Forum for a complete rundown of what has changed in this release.](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/31724)
-   **Charts Control:** The experimental [Charts Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/) is upgraded for 2.5.2 with support for integral legends and for three new series styles.
-   **ActionScript Source:** The ActionScript source for components that use Flash (Charts and [Uploader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader/)) is now available as part of the [download](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/) for developers who want to dig more deeply into these components.
