[![Download the free sample chapter of Christian Heilmann's new book on DOM scripting and AJAX.](/assets/heilmann-cover.gif)](/assets/HeilmannExcerpt.pdf) All of us at Yahoo! were excited this spring when long-time web developer and blogger [Christian Heilmann](http://wait-till-i.com) joined our increasingly deep and talented frontend engineering team in London. Christian had been working for etoys, had been involved in the development of dozens of high-profile sites (including [VisitBritain.com](http://visitbritain.com)), and is the author of the well-regarded web-developer site [ICant.co.uk](http://icant.co.uk).

Christian had also been working on a new book, [_Beginning JavaScript with Dom Scripting and Ajax, From Novice to Professional_](http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Beginning JavaScript with Dom Scripting and Ajax:3004735104:isbn=1590596803:page=compare), which is now coming off the presses and is soon to appear in book stores. In Chapter 11 of the new book, Christian explores the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) from an implementer's perspective and steps through a variety of code solutions using library components. We asked if we could share a free preview of the YUI section of the book here, and happily the editor at APress agreed.
