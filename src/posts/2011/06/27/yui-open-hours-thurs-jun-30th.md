### Preview of the new graphics API in 3.4.0

In the process of building the [Charts component](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/charts/) for version 3.3.0, we discovered there was a reasonable set of functionality that stood apart from a chart-centric implementation, such as basic 2D shape and path creation. There are a number of different mechanisms available in today's browser spectrum for creating and managing shapes, each with its own set of benefits and caveats, making it a prime candidate for creating a library API to take that burden off the developer. So we set about extracting and evolving those APIs from Charts into what will be in 3.4.0, the humble beginnings of YUI's graphics API.

Of course when I say "we", I mean Tripp Bridges. Tripp will join us to review the API, show some examples, and talk about the plan for the future of YUI's graphics layer.

As with the components in the last couple of Open Hours, you can play with this API today using [3.4.0PR2](/yuiblog/2011/06/23/yui-3-4-0-preview-release-2/). And we want your feedback (ok, and your testing).
