[![Christian Heilmann speaks at Yahoo on February 2, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/heilmann-20100203-125213.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=heilmann-yql)

YDN's international evangelist [Christian Heilmann](http://icant.co.uk), who works out of Yahoo!'s London office, was in Sunnyvale last week and gave an internal talk on the creation of effective demo applications using technologies like [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/) and [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/). While the talk is tailored for a Yahoo audience, the content is of general interest — and the advice about how best to create impactful demos is applicable for anyone who cares about illustrating the use of a given technology.

I asked Chris to repeat the talk in German; you'll find both the English and German versions below.
