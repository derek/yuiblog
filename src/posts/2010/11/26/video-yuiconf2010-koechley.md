Nate Koechley, one of the early members of the YUI team, came back to Yahoo! for YUIConf 2010 and broke down the elements of touch primitives, gestures and semantics, laying a foundation for the broader language of touch interactions that drive the emerging class of portable devices. This is a fantastic talk for all those thinking about the big picture of touch interactions and developing for touch UIs.
