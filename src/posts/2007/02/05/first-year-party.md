This month the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui) turns one year old. When we started last year [I wrote](/yuiblog/2006/02/13/welcome-to-the-yahoo-user-interface-blog/) that I was "thrilled to have you with us." That's never been truer than it is today. We owe an outstanding first year to you. Libraries aren't achievements themselves -- it's what people do with them that's exceptional. We love everything you're doing, so we're throwing a party to thank you, our amazing community.

Join us Thursday, February 22nd, from 5:30 to 8:30 PM, at [Yahoo! HQ](http://maps.yahoo.com/index.php#mvt=h&gid1=21328305&q1=701+First+Avenue%2C+Sunnyvale%2C+CA%2C+94089-0703&trf=0&lon=-122.02491&lat=37.416391&mag=3) in Sunnyvale, California. [Visit Upcoming.org for details and to RSVP](http://upcoming.org/event/148641). 300 people max, so RSVP early!

Beer. Food. Music. Guitar Hero on the projectors. Some other goodies and a few announcements we think you'll like. (No, not Beck.)

At 6:30 there will be a brief presentation by the YUI team. After that we'll have "built-with-YUI mini-demos", where some of you can take the stage for 5 minutes to show off how you've been using the YUI Library. There's only time for a handful of these quick talks before resuming the music and party around 7:15, so leave a note in the comments or send me an email directly (natek at yahoo-inc dot com) to get your proposal in.

That's it: [RSVP on Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/148641), send in demo proposals, and get ready to party with us on Thursday, Feb 22nd, from 5:30pm.

Thanks,  
Nate
