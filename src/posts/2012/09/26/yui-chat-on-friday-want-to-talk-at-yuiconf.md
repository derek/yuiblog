This **Friday September 28th** from **11:30 - 12:30 PDT** we will host an informal chat for anyone interested in talking about the proposal process for **YUIConf**. Are you on the fence about submitting a propsal? Don't know if your topic is developed enough for a talk? Come hang out with us online via G+ Hangout and we'll help you find the answers. Ping [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) [@ericf](http://twitter.com/ericf) or [@triptych](http://twitter.com/triptych) if you want a G+ invite.

We have created an editable [GDoc which you can use to add your ideas for YUIConf talks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jAqaUDd0M3NCIuL9Q-iO6zQX9CJVtPvSUY9yLF6zOs0/edit). Feel free to add, arrange, or comment on ideas listed here. If you want to "claim" an idea - just put your name next to it. For example "-Joe Cool".
