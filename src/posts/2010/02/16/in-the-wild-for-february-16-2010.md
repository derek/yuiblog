-   **[Matt Snider's YUI 3-based Radial Menus](http://www.mattsnider.com/widget/radial-menu/):** Matt Snider's [most recent project](http://www.mattsnider.com/widget/radial-menu/) was inspired by Bioware's designers: "Today's article is inspired by the Radial Menu found in many of Bioware's RPGs, such as Dragon Age. At the press of a button, the menu appears on the screen (usually pausing the game), and allows players to choose common commands. The same type of menu is possible on the web, and may even be more useful than the traditional navigation. We will use JavaScript, CSS, and YUI3 to build flexible Radial Menu widget that appears in the center of the page and responds to end-user clicks." Check out the [article](http://www.mattsnider.com/widget/radial-menu/) and the [example](http://www.mattsnider.com/tests/test_radialMenu.html) for full details.

So, I set out to connect the YUI Builder with my IDE."  [Read on for more details about Eric's approach](http://925html.com/techniques/auto-building-yui-3-custom-modules/).  And, in case you missed it, check out [Eric's presentation on custom modules from YUICONF 2009](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=ericf-yuiconf2009-webapps).

All you need to do is punch in your desired layout, specifying the page’s width (fixed or fluid), the number of columns you want, and how wide each of them should be. You can even split a section into two or more subsections, creating nested column layouts with ease."  The Grid Builder is a visual tool that works with [YUI 2's CSS Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/).
