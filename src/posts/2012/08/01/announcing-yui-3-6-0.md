![YUI 3.6.0](/yuiblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/yui-3-6-01.jpg "YUI 3.6.0")

We are happy to announce the release of YUI 3.6.0, now available on [CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.6.0/build/yui/yui-min.js) or as a [download](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.6.0.zip).

Among the highlights in this release are:

-   Significant boost in automated unit test coverage and an all-new suite of extensive automated example tests.
-   Improvements to the [YUI App Framework](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/): RESTful HTTP Model/ModelList sync layer, new [LazyModelList](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/model-list/#lazymodellist), and improved handling of hash-based URLs in the [Router](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/router/index.html).
-   New features and improvements for the [Uploader](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/uploader/) (file filtering, direct file list access, finer-grain control over request headers and properties).
-   A variety of bug fixes and improvements to the [Graphics](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/graphics/) module.
-   Awesome new examples that include [the Burger Builder](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/node/node-insert.html), [Store](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/node/store.html) and [Drag Handle](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/dd/drag-plugin.html).

The list of [issues addressed in 3.6.0](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/134) is available in our bug tracker. Additionally, you can check out the [change history rollup](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/YUI-3.6.0-Change-History-Rollup) for all components in the library.

We invite you to join the [ongoing development discussions](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Ongoing-Development-Discussions) happening with the team over on GitHub. For support, visit our [forums](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/), or join other YUI developers live in the #yui channel on irc.freenode.net (a web client is [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=yui)).

As we have forecast before, from this point on, we are transitioning to shorter releases. The roadmap for the next release will be available shortly. Stay tuned!
