[![YUI London Meetup on Upcoming](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/londonmeetup.gif)](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1154778/)If you're in London, please join us for [a YUI meetup on October 16 at 6:15 p.m. at the Yahoo! UK office on Shaftesbury Avenue](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1154778/).

Sophie Major and Christian Heilmann from the Yahoo Developer Network will be the hosts on the London side, and YUI engineers Matt Sweeney, Adam Moore and Satyen Desai will be participating by videoconference to give you a tour of (and progress report on) [YUI's upcoming 3.0 release](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/).

Like meetups we had here in California last month, this event will be small and informal — it's a good opportunity for us to get feedback from you on the 3.0 work, and likewise it's a good chance for you to hear directly from some of the project's principal developers. We hope to see you there.

After the YUI 3.x discussion via video conference, Christian and Sophie will be heading off to a local pub for more discussion and socializing.
