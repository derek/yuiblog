[Luke Wroblewski](http://lukew.com) (formerly eBay patterns; current Yahoo!), [Jenifer Tidwell](http://designinginterfaces.com/) (author of Designing Interfaces & Common Grounds pattern library), [Martijn van Welie](http://www.welie.com/) (pattern author), [James Refell](http://designcult.typepad.com/) (eBay patterns) and [myself](http://looksgoodworkswell.com) (Yahoo! patterns) have started a series of conversations around Design Patterns. You can find the [first installments on Luke's blog](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?347).

Here is how Luke introduces the conversation thread:

> In the Spring of 2006, a group of designers intimately familiar with the organization and development of design pattern resources got together to discuss the current and future role of design patterns in the real world. We talked about defining and documenting patterns, the context required to communicate how patterns should be applied, what it takes to develop a design language, and how disparate lists of patterns could converge. It’s our hope this conversation continues.

Here are the current posts:

-   [Design Patterns Introduction](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?347)
-   [Design Patterns: Part 1](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?348)
-   [Design Patterns: Part 2](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?349)

Enjoy the conversations, and we look forward to your contributions!
