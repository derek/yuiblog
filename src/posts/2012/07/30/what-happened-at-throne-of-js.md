A couple of weekends ago I packed up my laptop and my horns and headed over the border to lovely Toronto to play Devil's Advocate at the [Throne of JS conference](http://throneofjs.com/). This conference was different in that it focused _solely_ on JavaScript MVC (or MV\* if you will) libraries/frameworks and using them to build rich, dynamic web apps. I know what you're thinking, seems like a perfect venue to promote YUI and specifically the [App Framework components](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/), right? While I could have [done that](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCexiX_eUJA&hd=1), I decided to instead discuss the main premise of the entire conference:

> "It's no longer good enough to build web apps around **full page loads** then **progressively enhance** them to behave more dynamically. Building apps which are **fast**, **responsive** and **modern** require you to completely rethink your approach." \[emphesis added\] – [Throne of JS](http://throneofjs.com/)

We all want fast, responsive and modern web apps, but to build them, do we really have to give up progressive enhancement and completely rethink our approach to web development? I think that utilizing both the client and server in a coordinated way is a modern approach—by leveraging JavaScript in the browser to provide the responsiveness _and_ the server to provide the fastest initial rendering of your app. Having this balance, instead of doing everything on the server or everything on the client, means work can be done in the most optimal place and hopefully provide a better experience for the user. Here are [my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/ericf/p/advocatus-diaboli-throne-of-js) from my talk which go into more detail:

Also, [all the sessions](http://www.infoq.com/throne_of_js_2012/) were recorded, so you can **[watch and listen to my talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Web-Techniques)!**

Being able to spend a whole weekend geeking out about JavaScript MVC with application developers and library/framework authors lead to many invaluable conversations. Oh, and that everyone wants data-binding, and it's extremely difficult to implement correctly :).

I had a great time at the conference and visiting Toronto (which seems to be massively expanding!). I want to thank all the attendees and the other speakers for making the conference so great, and special thanks goes out to [Meghann Millard](https://twitter.com/meghatron), [Justin Giancola](https://twitter.com/elucid), and the [Unspace crew](http://unspace.ca/) for organizing the whole thing.
