First of all, we've reorganized the navigation for Yahoo!'s internal library and have now updated the navigation of the public library to match. We've done away with the first-order distinction of "User needs to" and "Application needs to." In the interests of fostering a user-centered (or, if you prefer, customer-centric) design perspective, we have reclassified all of the patterns in terms of a set of high-level user needs, because we feel that even things the application (or designer) "needs" to do must be driven ultimately by satisfying the need of an end-user. Currently, the top-level categories in the new organizational scheme include Search, Navigate, Read, Select, Interact, Give Feedback, and Customize. A few more will probably appear as we roll out additional patterns. Speaking of which, we are publishing a new pattern today, [Vote to Promote](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=votetopromote), which is our interpretation of the best way to incorporate a scheme to allow your users to vote up content, whether content native to your application or identified elsewhere (as with [Digg](http://digg.com/) and [Reddit](http://reddit.com/)). Vote to Promote was written by [Bryce Glass](http://soldierant.net), a senior interaction designer on our community platform team. It's the first in a series of "social media" patterns we've been working on now for much of this year, and you can expect a bunch more to appear over the next few months. Vote to Promote is also the first pattern to include a "pattern gallery." One bit of feedback we hear a lot - from you and from designers inside Yahoo! - is that more illustrations are better. This may sometimes show up in the form of diagrams, schematics, and templates. But each new pattern we release from now on will also feature a set of example images captured from across the Internet and displayed via Flickr. Check out [the Vote to Promote pattern gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/xian/sets/72157600669632171/detail/) and feel free to suggest additional examples. Let us know what you think of the new navigation scheme and the latest addition to the library. Thanks!
