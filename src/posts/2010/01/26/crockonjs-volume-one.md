About 200 people gathered in URLs Café at Yahoo! last night to take in the first installment of the [Crockford on JavaScript lecture series](/yuiblog/crockford/). Douglas took the audience through a selective history of computer science and programming languages, focusing on the evolution of those features and conventions that would later give shape to JavaScript.

While we're working on video from last night, we wanted [to share a few pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/equanimity/sets/72157623161722079/) and to let you know that we're adjusting our ticketing limits — if you [visit the lecture series page](/yuiblog/crockford/) and follow the RSVP links, you'll now see availability for some of the sessions that had previously been listed as sold out.
