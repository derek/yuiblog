## Details

Due to a recently discovered [SWF vulnerability](http://yuilibrary.com/support/20130515-vulnerability/), we are releasing YUI **3.10.1**. Any project which is self-hosting YUI 3 `.swf` files should read the [security bulletin](http://yuilibrary.com/support/20130515-vulnerability/) and take action to resolve potential vulnerabilities on your servers.

YUI **3.10.1** is identical to **3.10.0**, with the vulnerable `.swf` files replaced with patched files. YUI **3.10.1** also reflects fixes in our build system that prevented some files from being included in the release. No other code changes have been included with this release.

You can find YUI **3.10.1** on the [CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.10.1/build/yui/yui-min.js), as a [download](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.10.1.zip), and on [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/yui).

Special thanks to Aleksandr Dobkin and Sebastian Roschke of the Google Security Team for reporting the issue.

**Note:** This vulnerability is also listed under [CVE-2013-4939](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4939), [CVE-2013-4940](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4940), [CVE-2013-4941](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4941), and [CVE-2013-4942](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4942).
