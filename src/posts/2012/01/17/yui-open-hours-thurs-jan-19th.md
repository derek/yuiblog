### 3.5.0 DataTable update

A lot of progress has been made for 3.5.0 DataTable, and we want to show and tell the latest status of the code and API. There's plenty left to do, but we're excited for the new state of the art and want to make sure what's coming will meet your needs and expectations.

With a couple weeks left before 3.5.0 PR2 (scheduled for Jan 30th), there's still time to add features and polish, and the whole of PR3 to stress test and optimize, so things are looking good.

We'll cover what's there today, what will be there for PR2 and PR3, and what the feature roadmap is for upcoming versions. We'll dive into the code, talk about changes to the API, module structure, and table markup.
