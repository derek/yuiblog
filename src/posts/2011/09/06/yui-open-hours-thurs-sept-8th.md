### Contributing to YUI with Git and GitHub

We are now embracing [GitHub’s _Fork + Pull Model_](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) for accepting code changes to the [YUI project](https://github.com/yui/yui3)!

Join us this Thursday to talk about the details on how to use Git and GitHub to contribute to YUI, and how we are going to be managing Pull Requests. We will also do a live demo of issuing a Pull Request to the YUI project.

Be sure to also checkout out our [Contribute Code to YUI tutorial](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tutorials/contribute/), and bring your questions about Git and GitHub.

### Time & Details

This week we're going to host the session entirely on Adobe Connect, including the audio. We'll use the Connect chat to manage questions or use Connect's built in audio support for more in-depth discussions.

We'll be online in the **[Open Hours room](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/)** from **10am to 11am PDT Thursday**.

### Update: Video available

The recording for today's Open Hours is [available on our YouTube page](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWFqHNQ1mgg).
