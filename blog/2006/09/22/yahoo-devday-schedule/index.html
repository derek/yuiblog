Why do some communities meet offline so easily and others never do? Andy Baio, creator and co-founder of Upcoming.org, uses case studies and original interviews to try to understand this question. From the telegraph and ham radio to Digg and Yelp, he'll discuss the critical factors and best practices to get users out of the house and connecting in meatspace.</div> </div>

					<p><img alt="Nate Koechley" height="158" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/koechley.gif" width="120" />CSS <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">Reset</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/">Fonts</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">Grids</a> provide the CSS foundation upon which Yahoo! is building its future products &mdash; a foundation that allows for semantic, search-engine-optimized, accessible, progressively-rendered and font-scalable pages of significant variety and complexity. No single CSS solution is right for all developers and projects, but we're sharing our recipe going forward in hopes that others will find it useful and that it will contribute to the ongoing conversation about how to build semantic, scalable web-applications. In this workshop, the author of this platform, Nate Koechley, will take you through a series of use cases in which Reset, Fonts and Grids are deployed in the solution of realistic layout problems.</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Victor Tsaran,</em> Yahoo! accessibility evangelist</h4>
					<p><img alt="Victor Tsaran" height="148" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/tsaran.gif" width="120" />In this workshop we will look at several challenges that web 2.0 can present to its consumers if code development is done in haste and without proper symantic considerations. Not all users choose to use the mouse and not all of them may find drag-and-drop slow enough to respond in a timely fashion. So what's a hacker to do?<p>We will begin with a quick-pace introduction into assistive technology and then testcase several of Yahoo!'s interaction models to demonstrate how easy-to-use they may be for some users and difficult or impossible for others.<p>Come and hear this talk before you dive into hacking!</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Douglas Crockford,</em> Yahoo! JavaScript architect</h4>
					<p><img alt="Douglas Crockford" height="161" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/crockford.gif" width="120" />The drama of web-services hacks often plays out on the canvas of the web browser as a dynamic assembly of information within the browser's Document Object Model &mdash; a model not originally intended to support intensive GUI development. But the DOM API has proven both resilient <em>and</em> problematic in some surprising ways. Yahoo!'s leading JavaScript architect and <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> inventor Douglas Crockford will give you a introduction to the DOM and some valuable advice about how to avoid "hitting the wall" of performance in DOM-centric application development.</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Matt Sweeney,</em> author of the YUI Animation Utility and Dom Collection</h4>
					<p><img alt="Matt Sweeney" height="166" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/sweeney.gif" width="120" />Animation can be a powerful tool in the creation of learnable, intuitive rich interfaces. It can also add a degree of polish and smoothness that helps separate classy interfaces from also-rans. The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/">YUI Animation Utility</a> makes animation of DOM elements' visual properties a snap, whether singly or in custom combinations. This workshop, led by the Animation Utility's author, will introduce you to the core concepts and interfaces of this powerful component and its core classes.</div> </div>

					<p><img alt="Adam Moore" height="151" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/moore.gif" width="120" />Event-driven programming in the browser requires, at the most basic level, a tool that normalizes eccentric cross-browser behaviors and helps to mitigate patterns that lead to memory leaks in some mainstream browsers. The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/">YUI Event Utility</a> is a rich toolkit for creating and managing DOM event listeners, refining event-handler access to event-object properties and methods, and for creating "custom events" that publish interesting moments in your own applications to subscribers throughout the page context. Adam Moore, the Event Utility's author, will use this workshop time to work through some common use cases for the Event Utility's core elements.</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Matt Sweeney,</em> Author of the YUI Animation Utility and Dom Collection</h4>
					<p><img alt="Matt Sweeney" height="166" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/sweeney.gif" width="120" />In the past, HTML was pushed to do things that it was not originally designed to do. Now that CSS and JS have evolved to the point that they can be cleanly seperated from the markup layer, HTML can return to simply describing the document's content, letting CSS and JS control presentation and behavior. This allows the content to be self-sufficient; any HTML user agent can interpret the content if marked up correctly. This means that the same content can be presented in many different styles, with many different behaviors. When done correctly, this enables 100% access and simplifies testing and maintenance. When done incorrectly, users are blocked from accessing content, testing takes much longer, and maintenance time increases. This talk will focus on strategies for architecting HTML/CSS/JS systems to take full advantage of the power of each layer.</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Todd Kloots,</em> author of the YUI Menu Control</h4>
					<p><img alt="Todd Kloots" height="147" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/kloots.gif" width="120" />Menus are often the core navigation for a web site or application. As such they should be easy to use and accessible to all users regardless of how they choose to navigate: via their keyboard, mouse or with the help of a screen reader. The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/">YUI Menu controls</a> were designed with these goals in mind and make it easy to create application-style fly-out menus, customizable context menus, or navigation-style menu bars with (or without) existing markup and just a small amount of scripting. In this one-hour class, Todd Kloots, author of the YUI Menu family of controls, will cover the basics of the YUI Menu API and present several design patterns for developing navigation centered around accessibility and Progressive Enhancement.</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Rasmus Lerdorf,</em> Yahoo! platform architect and PHP creator</h4>
					<p><img alt="Rasmus Lerdorf" height="175" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/lerdorf.gif" width="120" />PHP has become amazingly popular due to its simple pragmatic approach to solving the web problem. As the web evolves and users demand even more dynamic web applications, the need for PHP keeps growing. People want richer web applications, they want AJAX, JSON and client-side magic to turn what used to be a series of linked pages into something resembling a desktop application.<p>In this talk Rasmus will cover the basic building blocks PHP 5 provides for building the backend of a rich web application and how to interact with client-side Javascript libraries and a variety of web services. There will be a heavy focus on performance with benchmarks and tips along the way.</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Steven Peterson,</em> author of the YUI Container and Calendar components</h4>
					<p><img alt="Steven Peterson" height="119" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/peterson.gif" width="120" />The age of pop-up blockers has, for many developers, meant the death of dialoging or messaging in context, requiring separate pages for gathering or displaying even the simple information. In-page panels and dialogs, built within the DOM, provide an alternative to pop-ups and can reopen the possiblity of contextual windows that either add information to the interface or gather additional information from the user. Two YUI components, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/panel/">Panel</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/dialog/">Dialog</a> (part of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/">Container</a> family of controls), are dedicated to helping you address these implementation cases. In this workshop, Container author Steven Peterson will guide you through the fundamentals of creating, configuring and managing your Panels and Dialogs.</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Iain Lamb,</em> Yahoo! DHTML/AJAX evangelism team, former Oddpost engineer</h4>
					<p><img alt="Lamb" height="160" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/lamb.gif" width="120" />The past five years have seen the emergence of significant new trends in what it means to "hack" in a networked world. Paul Rademacher's brilliant HousingMaps project broke new ground, reverse-engineering the Google Maps API and marrying it to Craigslist real estate listings, with a result so fundamentally <em>useful</em> that it transcended even the substantial virtues of the services on which it was built. It was a great moment for hackers, who had been mashing things up for decades; and the subsequent storm of mashups has brought the hacker back to center of the software-development fold.<p>In this new world of ecosystem-based hacking, however, a world of new skills and techniques is required. Iain Lamb, one of the original developers of Oddpost and now a member of Yahoo!'s elite DHTML/AJAX evangelism team, provides in this talk a guide to the new hacking landscape, including a top-ten list of literacies and techniques that we need to master to be full participants in hacking's ecosystem age.</div> </div>

Sha" height="138" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/sha.gif" width="120" />From Oddpost to Google Maps, some of the most important milestones in web development over the past five years have shared a common ingredient: The use of in-page HTTP requests to create "persistent interfaces" that endure while the user interacts with, adds, and enhances data. Driven by non-standard XMLHttpRequest interface pioneered by Microsoft, these kinds of applications are now supported by all major browsers. The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">YUI Connection Manager</a> is designed to help you take advantage of the power of asynchronous, in-page HTTP requests while insulating your application from some of the browser eccentricities that can arise when interacting directly with the various browser implementations. In this one-hour workshop, YUI team director and Connection Manager author Thomas S. Sha will give you a brief introduction to the Connection Manager and is use.</div> </div>

					<h4><em>Allen Rabinovich</em> of Yahoo!'s Flash platform team and <em>Chuck Freedman</em> of Yahoo! Maps</h4>
					<p><img alt="Allen Rabinovich and Chuck Freedman" height="282" src="/blog-archive/assets/devday/rabinovich_freedman.gif" width="120" />In this workshop, two of Yahoo!'s premier Flash developers will guide you through three sample Flash applications that utilize the Yahoo APIs. The three sample applications will include a Flash-based Yahoo Maps client (simplified), a Flickr Photo Viewer, and an Upcoming.org Event Viewer. For each of the applications, we'll describe in detail what tools the you'll need in order to leverage the Yahoo APIs; we'll also explore how the API functionality integrates into the Flash environment. <strong>Note: </strong> The applications explored in this workshop will be written in ActionScript 2; some familiarity with the Flash technology and the language will be required.</div> </div> </div> <p>Obviously, there's a lot in store for those of you who are planning to drop by for the Developer Day talks during the day on Friday (<strong>note: </strong>you can <a href="http://hackday.org">request an invitation</a> for that part of the event only if you know you won't be able to stay on into the weekend). The speaker includes talks by some of Yahoo!s most accomplished engineers and the sessions cover a wide range of APIs and other hack-related topics. YUI small-group, hands-on sessions fill one room and spill into a second, and our Matt Sweeney is giving one of the featured talks (now scheduled for 2:30 p.m.). See you Friday...</div>
