At the February 6, 2012 [BayJax](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/) event at Yahoo!, Flickr Frontend Engineer Eric Gelinas ([@standardpixel](http://twitter.com/standardpixel)) spoke about the challenges involved in building interfaces for geotagging and mapping. Using examples from Flickr and other sites, he covered the dos and don'ts of building geo interfaces and shared what he learned while building Flickr's geotagging UI.
