[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/flashblog.gif)](http://www.yswfblog.com/)The [YUI project](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) at Yahoo! has been focused for the past two years on building tools that enrich the basic paradigm of the browser: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM. The YUI project and YUIBlog continue to focus on that mission and on that fundamental paradigm.

Yahoo! announced yesterday another initiative related to frontend engineering — [a new blog, the Yahoo! Flash Blog](http://www.yswfblog.com/), that will be the voice of the Yahoo! Flash® Platform Team and a focal point for information about libraries and tools that the team develops and issues under an open-source license on the [Flash Developer Center](http://developer.yahoo.com/flash/):

> The Flash Platform team is developing the technical strategy and policy for Adobe technologies as it applies to Yahoo!. As such, we are focusing on developing libraries and platform solutions, methodologies and practices, as well as looking into emerging Adobe technologies.

> All of our libraries are planned to be released as open source, under a BSD license on the Yahoo! Developer Network and will be free for all uses. We would like to encourage you and the community to participate in active discussions and sharing code and solutions, because we believe it will help us to create better products — and do it faster.

If you’re interested in Adobe technologies like Flash and Air, be sure to check out the new blog and [add it to your RSS reader-of-choice](http://www.yswfblog.com/blog/feed/).
