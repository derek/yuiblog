"When I started this post, I was pretty certain my final choice will be jQuery.&nbsp; Then I started playing with Prototype and it looked really good, which kind of opened my eyes to the need to be open minded and objective.&nbsp; This led to a more objective look at YUI and the conclusion to use YUI.&nbsp; I was very impressed with YUI’s look&amp;feel, extensive documentation, testing framework and the icing on the cake was the free hosting of the JavaScript libraries.&nbsp; This was a really tough decision..."&nbsp; Emad discusses his pros and cons for three major libraries (YUI, Prototype and jQuery) and there is further discussion in the comments section.<li id="yuiBlogWild-123"><a href="http://htmlblog.net/alternate-colors-to-table-rows-with-javascript-yui/"><img align="right" hspace="10" src="/blog-archive/assets/tablestripinghtmlblog-20081216-140642.png" vspace="5" /></a><strong><a href="http://htmlblog.net/alternate-colors-to-table-rows-with-javascript-yui/">YUI-based Table Striper</a>:</strong> Asvin Balloo is back with a new YUI-based helper script for striping the color on table rows.<li id="yuiBlogWild-122"><strong><a href="http://chris-barr.com/entry/how_to_use_the_yui_compressor/">How to Use the YUI Compressor</a>:</strong> Writes Chris Barr: "Compressing your javascript and CSS is a easy way to save bandwidth and make a site’s download and performance feel a bit snappier. There’s lots of tools to allow you to do this, but from my research it seems that Yahoo!‘s YUI compressor is the overall best.&nbsp; Sure there's others out there like JSmin and Dean Edward’s packer, but YUI offers a higher compression ratio, it also works with CSS files, and it won't obfuscate your code."&nbsp; <a href="http://chris-barr.com/entry/how_to_use_the_yui_compressor/">His blog post</a> offers a tutorial on using YUI to compress jQuery.

By widget, I’m referring to items such as javascript date pickers, tooltips, autocomplete inputs, etc. I’m building on top of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> for this approach, but the principles I’d like to discuss are applicable to any library. YUI provides a fantastic javascript library, and a collection of widgets right out of the box. More than likely, as you add them to your application, you’ll want to wrap or extend them in your own javascript implementations to get them functioning as desired. To accomplish this, I typically have taken one of two approaches, and these are the topic I’d like to cover. To provide a working example, I’ll use a simple wrapper for a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/">YUI Calendar</a> widget that is linked to a text input, and opens by clicking a calendar icon."&nbsp; <a href="http://www.selfcontained.us/2008/12/23/javascript-widget-approaches-singleton-vs-prototype/">Check out his post</a> for the full deep dive on the subject.<li id="yuiBlogWild-134"><strong><a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2008/12/19/fireunit-extension-for-yui-test/">FireUnit Extension for YUI Test</a>:</strong> <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/">YUI Test</a> author Nicholas C. Zakas has released <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2008/12/19/fireunit-extension-for-yui-test/">an experimental hookup between YUI Test and the new FireUnit Firebug extension on his personal blog</a>: "When I wrote <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/">YUI Test</a>, I made sure that the TestRunner object was completely event-driven so that test results could be output in any way that made sense. To prove how easy it is to create your own visualization for YUI Test results, I created a FireUnit extension for YUI Test. The extension is nothing exciting, just a simple JavaScript object that subscribes to the various TestRunner events and then marshals them to the appropriate FireUnit API calls. All you need to do is load the file and include the following line of code: <code>YAHOO.tool.FireUnit.attach();</code>. That’s it! All the results will be output to the Test tab in Firebug.

Writes Matt:&nbsp; "Today’s article illustrates an experimental function that parses a string, containing instructions for searching the DOM relative to a node. This method was inspired by a desire to allow a separate design team to specify the relative location of other DOM nodes. This way, parts of the JavaScript that handle user triggered events (such as ‘click’) need not hardcode relative nodes.&nbsp; For example, suppose when the user clicks on an anchor, a relative node is made visible and the design team frequently changes the location of that node. An ID could be used, but that doesn’t work as well with dynamically generated content..."&nbsp; <a href="http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/library-yui-3-dynamic-dom-search-experimen/">Check out Matt's blog</a> for source code and further ruminations.<li id="yuiBlogWild-141"><strong><a href="http://www.lateralcode.com/2009/01/enhancing-search-boxes-with-yui/">Enhancing Search Boxes With YUI</a>:</strong> Karthik Viswanathan wrote a YUI AutoComplete implementation tutorial on Lateral Code.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lateralcode.com/2009/01/enhancing-search-boxes-with-yui/">Writes Karthik</a>: "earch boxes enable users to find what they need quickly and efficiently.

He took an existing solution <a href="http://ericmiraglia.com/yui/demos/tabcookie.php">using cookies to preserve Tab state</a> and adapted it to Grails; <a href="http://cochransoftware.blogspot.com/2009/01/grails-rich-ui-maintaining-tab-on.html">he posted his solution on his blog</a>.&nbsp; (Note: <a href="http://grails.org/RichUI+Plugin">RichUI</a>, a Grails plugin, draws from several JavaScript libraries; many of the controls, including TabView, are from YUI.)
