[![Ryan Dahl's Talk at the BayJax event at Yahoo! on May 5th, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/dahl-node-blog-5-5-10.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=dahl-node)

Two weeks ago, Yahoo! hosted a [BayJax](www.meetup.com/BayJax/) meetup dedicated to [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org/) (since the meetup coincided with Cinco de Mayo, we named it 'Cinco de Node'). [Ryan Dahl](http://github.com/ry), the creator of NodeJS, gave a talk on the project and was very kind to let us record his presentation for YUI Theater.

P.S. The video opens with a 30-second glimpse into the Cinco the Mayo celebrations at Yahoo!
