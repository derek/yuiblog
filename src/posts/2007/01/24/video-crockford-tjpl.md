[![Douglas Crockford provides a comprehensive introduction to the JavaScript Programming Language.](http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/ydn/yuiweb/img/theater/crockford-tjpl2.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ifWcnQs6M)I've shared on YUIBlog and in [the YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/) two presentations created by Yahoo! JavaScript Architect [Douglas Crockford](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/douglas-crockford/) (["Advanced JavaScript"](/yuiblog/blog/2006/11/27/video-crockford-advjs/) and["An Inconvenient API: The Theory of the Dom"](/yuiblog/blog/2006/10/20/video-crockford-domtheory/)). Today I'm happy to announce that Douglas's more foundational talk "The JavaScript Programming Language," is publicly available. In this presentation, which is meant to be the beginning of the three-course sequence (followed by "Theory of the DOM" and then "Advanced JavaScript"), Douglas explores not only the language as it is today but also how the language came to be the way it is.

It's always worth pointing out that ideas and perspectives are Douglas's own and that the many eggregious flaws in videographic craftsmanship are mine.
