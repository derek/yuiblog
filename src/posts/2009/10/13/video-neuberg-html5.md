[![Brad Neuberg speaking at Yahoo! during the BayJax Meetup on October 7, 2009.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/neuberg-html5-20091008-233653.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=neuberg-html5)

[Brad Neuberg](http://codinginparadise.org) of the Google Developer programs stopped by Yahoo! last week talk about HTML5. Brad has been hard at work on [SVG Web](http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/) lately, but he covered a lot of ground in this talk, including SVG/Canvas rendering, CSS transforms, app-cache, local databases, web workers, and much more. Brad does a fantastic job identifying the scope and practical implications of the changes that are coming along with HTML5 support in modern browsers. And he pulls no punches about which browsers fall into the "modern" category at this point.

Brad was on campus as part of the [BayJax Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/); thanks to BayJax's organizers, and particularly Yahoo! engineer Gonzalo Cordero, for making the arrangements for the event and providing food and beverages. This was our third Yahoo!-hosted BayJax, and once again it was a stimulating evening with excellent speakers.
