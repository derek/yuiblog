[![YUI engineer Allen Rabinovich speaks at YUIConf 2010 at Yahoo! HQ in Sunnyvale, CA.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf2010-rabinovich-20101125-003511.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-rabinovich)

In one of the most creative presentations at [YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/), YUI developer Allen Rabinovich ([@allenr](http://twitter.com/allenr)) reflects on the many different roles played by frontend engineers as part of their natural generative process. The talk unfolds with a continuous scrolling illustration which is gradually revealed, adding layers of meaning to Allen's narration. If you consider yourself to be a frontend engineer who reflects on the nature of the work you do, this is a talk you won't want to miss.
