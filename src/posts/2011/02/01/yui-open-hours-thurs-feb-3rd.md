The next YUI: Open Hours will be next Thursday, Feb 3rd.

Last week we collected some ideas and feedback from you about the YUI project roadmap for 2011. The discussion is hardly over, and we want to keep hearing from you [in the forums](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=6745), but it's time to get back into the code!

### Main Topic: YUI 3 CSS Grids

[YUI CSS Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/cssgrids/) has been completely revamped in YUI 3, centering on a cross-browser `display: inline-block;` implementation. The new CSS Grids is more powerful while being simpler to use, and smaller in size. You should check out the [YUI 3 CSS Grids examples](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/cssgrids/).

#### Grids in the Wild

I recently setup a [blog for TipTheWeb](http://blog.tiptheweb.org/) on [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) and wanted to create a custom theme for the blog. I used this opportunity to try out new YUI CSS Grids which I used it extensively for creating the theme's layout; in fact, **I did not use any `float`s**!

In this week's Open Hours I wanted to talk through my experiences using YUI 3's CSS Grids for web page layout on [TipTheWeb's Blog](http://blog.tiptheweb.org/), show some code, and talk through the more complex nested-grid structures. It would also be awesome to have other people to show off their projects that are using YUI 3 CSS Grids and talk through their experiences as well!

#### Annotating Pages That Use YUI 3 Grids

To make it easier to talk about pages using Grids I created a little tool: [**YUI 3 CSS Grids Annotations**](http://oddnut.com/yui3-grids-annotations/) it's a bookmarklet that annotates the grid structure of a web page using YUI 3 CSS Grids, also the source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericf/yui3-grids-annotations/) :-)
