_**Update 12:32 p.m. 12/21/2010:** Back up and running -- let us know if you see any issues._

We've taken YUILibrary.com down this morning for maintenance. We expect this work to last 4-6 hours. We apologize for the inconvenience and we'll try to keep the downtime as short as possible.

If you have urgent support questions in the meantime, consider dropping by the #yui channel on Freenode.net, where you'll often find dozens of YUI community members helping each other out.

YUIBlog and [@YUILibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) will run updates when the site is back up.
