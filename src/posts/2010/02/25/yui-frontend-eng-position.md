If working alongside people like [Douglas Crockford](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-yuiconf2009-state "Video: Douglas Crockford — The State and Future of JavaScript (YUI Theater)") and on the team that created [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ "YUI Library") ([Matt Sweeney](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=sweeney-yuiconf2009-performance "Video: Matt Sweeney — YUI 3 Performance (YUI Theater)"), [Adam Moore](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/yui/ "YUI 3: YUI Global Object"), [Dav Glass](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=glass-yuiconf2009-contributing "Video: Dav Glass — Contributing to YUI (YUI Theater)"), [Jenny Donnelly](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/4693580/12542476 "Jenny Donnelly: "), [Luke Smith](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=smith-yuiconf2009-events "Video: Luke Smith — Events Evolved (YUI Theater)"), [Tripp Bridges](/yuiblog/2010/02/18/an-update-on-yui-3-charts/), [Allen Rabinovich](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=rabinovich-yuiconf2009-charts "Video: Allen Rabinovich — YUI 3 Infographics (YUI Theater)"), [Satyen Desai](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets "Video: Satyen Desai — A Widget Walkthrough (YUI Theater)"), and others) sounds like a good way to spend your time, read on: [We're hiring](http://careers.yahoo.com/jdescription.php?oid=28177 "Job Description: YUI team engineer").

We're looking for a great engineer to help us with every facet of the YUI project. (Note: This role is in addition to [the build/CI position we announced a few weeks ago](http://careers.yahoo.com/jdescription.php?oid=27619 "Job Description: YUI team engineer")). This may be a great job for you if you are:

-   familiar with best practices in frontend engineering (e.g., [this video](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/4671445/12486762 "Nate Koechley: ") should resonate for you);
-   an unabashed JavaScript geek (e.g., [this video](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=eich-yuiconf2009-harmony) and [this video](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockonjs-3) should be the kind of thing you get excited to download and watch on the big screen in HD);
-   someone who thinks making web applications screamingly fast is a moral obligation;
-   someone who thinks APIs should be easy to use while solving hard problems, and someone who knows how to create that kind of API;
-   someone who thinks about how users will interact with your work if they aren't adept with a mouse or can't visually read the computer screen;
-   a passionate communicator as well as a passionate developer.
-   Read the [full job description](http://careers.yahoo.com/jdescription.php?oid=28177 "Job Description: YUI team engineer") for more details.

The best part of any job in technology is having the chance to do influential work in an environment that both challenges and supports your growth. The YUI team provides just that confluence of characteristics: a huge, engaged community of users and developers and a team of brilliant engineers collaborating every day to improve the project.

If this sounds like your dream job, and if the people I mentioned above sound like people you'd want to work with every day, I'd love to hear from you. Tell me why you're the right person for this role, including a link to your resume and professional portfolio, by emailing yui \[dash\] jobs \[at\] yahoo-inc.com. (Principals only; no recruiters.)
