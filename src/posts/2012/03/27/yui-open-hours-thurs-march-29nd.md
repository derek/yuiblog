### 3.5.0 Examples update

We got our ducks in a row last week and launched 3.5.0 PR4 (yay!). So this week we'll focus on the documentation; particularly, the new and revitalized examples that will be included with 3.5.0.

Jeff Conniff, our mild mannered designer, will walk us through the example updates and additions, and we'll open the floor to suggestions for specific examples you'd like to see, as well as the types, locations, and formats for examples that you find most useful.

### Recording

The recording is [available in the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gta53x24UyU&hd=1&list=PL29854C3883AA8170).
