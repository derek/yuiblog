We are very pleased to announce the addition of [Caridy Patino](https://github.com/caridy) to the YUI team. Caridy joins us from his former role in Yahoo! Search where he worked on such projects as [Yahoo! Axis](http://axis.yahoo.com/). Caridy has been a longtime contributor to [Mojito](https://github.com/yahoo/mojito) and will focus on spearheading its next-generation rearchitecture, which will be highlighted by greater modularity and better integration with YUI. Caridy has published many [YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/user/caridy) components as well.

From Caridy:

> "Even though this is not a big change for me since I have been working fulltime with Mojito and YUI team for the last 6 months, I'm stoked to formally become part of the team."

Caridy cited his goal of joining the YUI team as reason why he originally joined Yahoo! and "... here I am now, working with this group of friends that are incredibly talented and passionated about the frontend discipline."
