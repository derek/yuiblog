[![A panel of thought leaders and influencers in the world of frontend engineering on stage at Yahoo for a special panel discussion at YUIConf.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf2010-panel-20101117-133251.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-panel)

One of the highlights of YUIConf 2010 was a panel discussion on the future of frontend engineering, facilitated by Dion Almaer and Ben Galbraith (of Ajaxian, Bespin, Mozilla, and Palm fame). Panelists included Elaine Wherry, founder and frontend architect at Meebo; Douglas Crockford, JavaScript architect at Yahoo!; Tantek Çelik, technologist and author; Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.js; Joe Hewitt of Facebook, creator of Firebug and one of the most downloaded mobile applications of all time (Facebook for iOS); Thomas Sha, YUI founder at Yahoo!.

Our thanks to all of the panelists and the moderators for a memorable evening.

-   [**Alois Reitbauer:** dynaTrace Ajax Edition](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=reitbauer-dynatrace) — dynaTrace provides one of the most powerful tools for analyzing the performance of web applications in Internet Explorer. In this talk, dynaTrace engineer Alois Reitbauer walks through four specific analytic scenarios using the dynaTrace interface.
-   [**Dav Glass:** Using Node.js and YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=glass-node) — YUI 3 and Node.js, working together, help us fully realize the promise of progressive enhancement (and a lot of other cool stuff). Dav Glass of the YUI team shows how it's done and what's possible using these powerful tools together.
-   [**Ryan Grove:** Achieving Performance Zen with YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=grove-zen) — Following codified guidelines \[http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/\] can help you build fast websites, but building applications that are clean, fast and extensible also involves taking a balanced approach to performance at every level of your F2E work. YUI 3 is designed to help you in this process, providing a right-sized abstraction layer with built-in performance magic and a variety of tools that make fast frontend code easy and fun to produce. In this session, we'll explore the zen of performant JavaScript in the YUI 3 world and introduce you to some of the powerful tools YUI 3 puts at your disposal in every app you write.
-   [**Douglas Crockford:** Crockford on JavaScript -- Scene 6: Loopage](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-loopage) — Software development is hampered by a specific set of design mistakes that were made in the first programming languages and repeated in everything that has been done since. And, somewhat miraculously, JavaScript is going to make it right, radically transforming the way we write applications. Again. In the Loop of History, it has all happened before, but it has never happened like this. This is why you should care about the emergence of server-side JavaScript and the excitement around projects like Node.js — not because they're at the sharp end of a trend, but because they're paving the road toward the next big revolution in software.
