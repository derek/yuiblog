						<div class="entry">
							<p>The single most important concept to master when designing mobile device interfaces is &#8220;context&#8221;. The context in which an application is used and the context of how information is input are both key issues; each must be understood before a well crafted design may be implemented. When these two notions of context are explored, it becomes clear that designing for a mobile device can lead to a solution that is worlds different than its desktop equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="context-of-use">Context of Use</h3>
<p>Mobile devices are excellent at connecting users to information; and while consumption of information is likely the largest segment of mobile device usage, interacting with a mobile device to perform important tasks is a usage segment that deserves significant attention. This is because generative work conducted on mobile devices tends to be tactical in nature and demands a sense of immediacy. Users have a very specific need and desire to accomplish their goal in the easiest and fastest way possible. This fact alone helps explain why mobile interfaces are designed the way they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature sets are optimized to streamline common use cases</li>
<li>Use typography to show hierarchy and importance</li>
<li>Features are progressively displayed</li>
<li>Large buttons are used to make interactions actionable</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore a mobile email client as an example of how these attributes are manifested.</p>
<h4 id="streamline-common-use-cases">Streamline Common Use Cases</h4>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re lounging at the beach, riding the subway, or at a client meeting, the need to access email on your mobile device is likely predicated by a sense immediacy. If at this point you thought &#8220;What about boredom?&#8221;, I&#8217;d like to remind you of the beach scenario. A complex interaction involving zooming, tiny check boxes, and the like is the last thing one needs. Several mobile email applications address this challenge by displaying an optimized interface that allows users to select an inbox or folder, view a list of messages, and then act on a specific message. Though this model may not be best when dealing with bulk actions, it simplifies the interaction to a primary use case and allows users to get the information they need. Once the user has access to the information being sought, additional options are contextually presented. </p>
<h4 id="show-hierarchy-and-importance">Show hierarchy and importance</h4>
<p>Instead of using a data table layout with dedicated columns for each piece of email meta data, the iPhone email interface groups sender, date, subject, and message status information into repeating units that make identifying a message a simple task. By varying font size, weight, color, and style, one is able to discretely communicate each morsel of information without having to label it. This not only reduces interface clutter but allows the data to speak for itself.</p>
<h4 id="progressively-display-features">Features are progressively displayed</h4>
<p>While performing bulk actions like flagging several messages is an extremely useful feature, it is probably not a primary activity performed on a mobile device. In the case of the iPhone, options to delete a message, reply, and move to a different folder are are only displayed when viewing a message. Taking this concept one step further, tapping the reply icon allows the user to specify if they wish to reply, reply all, or forward the message. By simplifying the mechanism for how one selects a message to a single click, and removing the ability select multiple messages, all features that deal with acting on a message are progressively disclosed in context of that message.</p>
<h4 id="use-large-buttons">Large buttons are used to make interactions actionable</h4>
<p>When you use a laptop or desktop computer, chances are that you&#8217;re in a very controlled environment; lighting is good, you sit a comfortable distance from the monitor, and using a mouse or trackpad to control a screen cursor is a simple task. In contrast, mobile devices may be used in unpredictable situations; outdoors in very bright light, in the course of another activity (like driving), or while in constant motion&#8212which makes coordinated movements difficult to perform. By making the clickable area of an action large, many of these issues are resolved. When highlighted by a contrasting background color, important actions are more easily seen and targeted even when overall screen contrast is poor. Most important of all, a large click area requires less precision and effort to activate; an excellent manifestation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts_law">Fitts&#8217;s law</a>.</p>
<h3 id="context-of-the-medium">Context of the medium</h3>
<p>Interfaces designed for a desktop internet browser experience are usually not optimized for a mobile internet browser. Aside from the issues arising out of the context of use, the mobile device itself may present you with challenges and opportunities not present in the desktop realm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with phone numbers and other mobile friendly data</li>
<li>Displaying information on a smaller screen</li>
<li>Not using a cursor</li>
<li>Device speed and network latency</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="phone-numbers-and-other-data">Dealing with phone numbers and other mobile-friendly data</h4>
<p>If your mobile web application displays phone numbers, making it easy for a user to dial that phone number should be a top priority. By using the tel: URI scheme and linking a phone number, many mobile internet browsers will dial the linked phone number.</p>
<p>Some mobile devices may redirect certain URLs to native applications. This is the case with the iPhone redirecting YouTube and Google Maps URLs to the onboard application, but can also be observed with phones that automatically open the built-in calendar when an iCal file is downloaded, or open the built-in address book when a vCard file is downloaded. To design an experience that can gracefully coexist with others tools, one needs to understand what kind of media can be processed by specific mobile internet browsers, and when onboard applications are launched.</p>
<h4 id="displaying-info-on-a-smaller-screen">Displaying information on a smaller screen</h4>
<p>While most desktop web applications are designed for 800&#215;600 or 1024&#215;768 resolutions, mobile devices employ significantly smaller displays. Some mobile browsers scale graphics to fit their screen width and some mobile browsers allow the user to scale and magnify a portion of the interface. Using traditional web development techniques of creating fluid designs that scale horizontally is the fastest way to deploy a single design to many different mobile devices.</p>
<p>Older mobile devices may have a horizontal resolution of as few as 96 pixels while newer models have horizontal resolutions of 240 or 320 pixels. If you are bothered by the wide range of horizontal resolutions and feel that your design options are discretely different for different resolutions, think about creating resolution-specific CSS files. Common horizontal resolutions are 96, 128, 176, 240, and 320 pixels.</p>
<p>If you have the luxury of targeting specific devices, don&#8217;t overlook the option of serving device-specific CSS files. Doing this allows you to fine-tune object dimensions for a specific device as well as customizing your application&#8217;s skin to provide an onboard application feel, if so desired.</p>
<h4 id="not-using-a-cursor">Not using a cursor</h4>
<p>Mice, joysticks, scroll-wheels, keypads, fingers, and styli&#8212;oh my! Different mobile devices require different tools to interact with their interfaces. While each of these input tools accomplishes the essential task of selecting an object, each also presents us with limitations.</p>
<p>Joysticks, scroll-wheels, and keypads typically use up/down commands to scroll content and automatically focus on fields, links, and buttons. In essence, this limits a designer and developer to listening for focus, blur, and click events. Advanced devices that use fingers and/or styli as the input tool may provide access to more events, but here too a wide range of device specific behavior may restrict event listening to a small set. Blazer and PocketIE browsers, depending on device configurations, may allow a user to scroll a page by using a stylus to interact with scroll bars; the same browser on a different device may be limited to a joystick input tool. The Safari browser on the iPhone offers page scrolling by allowing the user to push the page in the direction of the scroll. Whereas Blazer and PocketIE browsers could allow for the opportunity for direct object manipulation (like drag and drop), such an action is not natively available on the iPhone because the act of dragging is reserved for a system-level interactions.</p>
<p>All is not lost, however. Just because a device does not support dragging or double clicking does not mean it has a poor event model. The act of dragging an object to a drop area may seem trivial&#8212;but when this action needs to be performed in a moving subway while clinching a hand strap, the mechanics involved can range from being frustrating (using one&#8217;s thumb to drag and other fingers to hold device) to outright masochistic (trying to control a stylus from moving around a slippery surface).</p>
<h4 id="device-speed-and-network-latency">Device speed and network latency</h4>
<p>Until the day that WiFi and WiMAX technologies are built into every mobile device, planning on data transfers via GPRS and EDGE networks is a reality&#8212;which means data is transfered as slow as 60 kbits/sec. Even if one is able to overcome the speed and latency of a slow data network, there&#8217;s still the mobile device&#8217;s processor and RAM to contend with. As expected, a desktop or laptop computer is several times more powerful than a typical mobile device. Complex code execution on a mobile device may therefore be several times slower than the same code run on a desktop computer. More importantly, mobile devices are all about the consumption of information; lightweight interfaces (both in terms of features and bytes) deliver information faster.</p>
<h3 id="what-it-boils-down-to">What it boils down to</h3>
<p>Simplifying interactions and streamlining access to information may not be as cool as crafting richer interactions, but they are the most effective techniques available at producing a design that is easy to use on a mobile platform. Simplified interfaces can also lead to leaner code, which means less data is transfered over slow connections.</p>
<p>Designing with awareness to context will yield a more atomic design that instead of introducing users to a proverbial blank canvas, will guide them toward accomplishing important tasks. Having to deal with slow data speeds, high network latency, smaller screens, and an unpredictable mode of use only reinforce the need to isolate an application&#8217;s essential features and offer access to them when contextually appropriate.</p>
<p>Next time you design an interface for a mobile device, remember to consider context of use and context of the medium as part of your design strategy.</p>

						<div class="entry">
							<p><a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=votetopromote'><img style='margin: 0 1em 1em 0;' src='/yuiblog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/pattern_vote2promote_sub.gif' alt='thumbnail of a Digg page, the canonical example of the Vote to Promote pattern' title='thumbnail of a Digg page, the canonical example of the Vote to Promote pattern'/ align='left' ></a>Things have been quiet recently in Yahoo&#8217;s open pattern library, but behind the scenes we&#8217;ve been working on some cool stuff. First of all, we&#8217;ve reorganized the navigation for Yahoo!&#8217;s internal library and have now updated the navigation of the public library to match. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve done away with the first-order distinction of &#8220;User needs to&#8221; and &#8220;Application needs to.&#8221; In the interests of fostering a user-centered (or, if you prefer, customer-centric) design perspective, we have reclassified all of the patterns in terms of a set of high-level user needs, because we feel that even things the application (or designer) &#8220;needs&#8221; to do must be driven ultimately by satisfying the need of an end-user.</p>
<p>Currently, the top-level categories in the new organizational scheme include Search, Navigate, Read, Select, Interact, Give Feedback, and Customize. A few more will probably appear as we roll out additional patterns.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we are publishing a new pattern today, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=votetopromote">Vote to Promote</a>, which is our interpretation of the best way to incorporate a scheme to allow your users to vote up content, whether content native to your application or identified elsewhere (as with <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Vote to Promote was written by <a href="http://soldierant.net">Bryce Glass</a>, a senior interaction designer on our community platform team. It&#8217;s the first in a series of &#8220;social media&#8221; patterns we&#8217;ve been working on now for much of this year, and you can expect a bunch more to appear over the next few months. </p>
<p>Vote to Promote is also the first pattern to include a &#8220;pattern gallery.&#8221; One bit of feedback we hear a lot &#8211; from you and from designers inside Yahoo! &#8211; is that more illustrations are better. This may sometimes show up in the form of diagrams, schematics, and templates. But each new pattern we release from now on will also feature a set of example images captured from across the Internet and displayed via Flickr. Check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xian/sets/72157600669632171/detail/">the Vote to Promote pattern gallery</a> and feel free to suggest additional examples.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the new navigation scheme and the latest addition to the library. Thanks!</p>

<p>With the goal of better understanding how people interact with the Web via various types of Assistive Technology (AT) &#8212; and what that might mean for developers and designers &#8212; Karo Caran takes us on a 16 minute overview of screen magnification software (in this case <a href="http://www.synapseadaptive.com/aisquared/zoomtext_9/zoomtext_9_magnifier_reader.htm">ZoomText</a>) and how it is used by partially-sighted users to interact with the Web. Karo shows you the basic toolkit and then applies those tools to some typical web sites to give you some perspective on how she uses magnification software while she browses the web.</p>
<p>Though screen <em>readers</em> get most of the press, it&#8217;s good to remember that it&#8217;s not the only AT game in town.</p>

						<h2 id="post-87"><a href="/yuiblog/blog/2007/03/05/pattern-library-anniversary/">Happy Birthday to the Pattern Library, Too!</a></h2>
					

						<div class="entry">
							<p>We recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the open-source release of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI Library</a>. It is also the one-year anniversary of the public release of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Yahoo! Design Pattern Library</a>. Not wanting to miss out on the fun, we published two new patterns: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=calendar">Calendar Picker</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=alphafilterlinks">Alphanumeric Filter Links</a>.</p>
<p>This is also a good opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Christian Crumlish. I am an information architect, interaction designer, writer, and the new curator of the Pattern Library. I think of myself as a pattern <em>detective</em> because a big part of my job is to uncover successful patterns on the Yahoo! network and &#8220;in the wild&#8221; and capture and document them for eventual publication in the Pattern Library.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got some big shoes to fill. Matt Leacock was our first pattern librarian, launched our internal pattern library, developed many of the earliest patterns, and established a structure and process for the library. Bill Scott oversaw the public release of the pattern library as you you probably remember from his posts on this blog and the slew of fantastic Ajax patterns (among others) that he shepherded into the library. Fortunately they&#8217;re both still nearby for me to hassle when I&#8217;m not sure what to do, as is Erin Malone whose leadership has driven the development and release of the library all along.</p>
<h3 id="newest-patterns">The two newest patterns</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=calendar">Calendar Picker</a> comes in handy when users need to select dates or date ranges. Probably the canonical scenario is travel planning. Airline reservation systems all use some variation on the calendar picker pattern and the best ones do a good job of anticipating the date vicinity, especially for the return portion of a round trip. The YUI Library has a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/">Calendar</a> control which this pattern complements.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=alphafilterlinks">Alphanumeric Filter Links</a> sound deceptively simple: a common segmentation of large information repositories for easier navigation. (Of course this only works in alphabetic languages!) However, our internal review process uncovered a number of gotchas related to alphabetization and found a number of variations of this pattern to address distinct scenarios. Basic list filtering driven by text-links is so &#8220;Web 1.0&#8243; so we&#8217;ll be sure to relate this context to Auto Complete and other dynamic ways of sorting and filtering long lists of data. As we build up the Pattern Library we&#8217;ll group them together under an umbrella parent pattern.</p>
<p>As always, we welcome discussion, feedback, and suggestions about these patterns on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-patterns/">ydn-patterns</a> list. I&#8217;ll be announcing new pattern releases here on the YUI Blog, and will continue the series of exploratory posts and essays Bill Scott started. Together I expect we will contribute to the public discussion of design pattern, interaction design, information architecture, and user experience in general.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m constantly amazed at the power of design patterns to communicate. I&#8217;ve found that a well-described pattern can both convey both a specific solution (which can help me solve a difficult design problem) and the core interaction principles that underly all good patterns (which can help make me a better designer).</p>
<p>While designers will probably always be the primary authors of and audience for design patterns, I&#8217;m finding more and more that they&#8217;re useful in communicating with all sorts of folks. These include not only the developers who are responsible for building our designs but also the business folks, product managers, and other non-designers. There&#8217;s also a big difference between talking to other designers inside an organization (as with eBay or Yahoo&#8217;s internal pattern libraries) and talking to a more general design audience (as with books or the public libraries).</p>
<p>The core pieces of information – What, Use When, Why, How, and Examples – are necessary to tell the story of each pattern for all audiences, and Who becomes a big deal in an internal library. Users of an internal library might also find links to internal design standards and specifications useful, as well as a list of places where the pattern appears. Additionally, as Bill points out, if the pattern will be used by a specific developer audience, the How and Examples might add sample code and implementation details. Since patterns aren&#8217;t exactly built in stone, it&#8217;s also helpful to add things like ratings, discussions, links to similar patterns, and the like.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve added all these additional pieces of information you have something that&#8217;s grown well beyond just a design library – and that&#8217;s OK as long as it works for the intended audience, and as long as those first core pieces are in place!</p>
<p>So much for the parts of the whole. I think it&#8217;s also important to look at the pattern description as a whole and coherent story, however. Narrative is an important tool for communication, and I think we might not take advantage of it enough – some pattern descriptions can get a little clinical. I prefer to see the examples rounded out with some history—and maye some drama and a few laughs! There&#8217;s no harm in telling how we came to realize a given pattern was a good solve, the bumps along the road, the other things that we&#8217;ve tried and have failed entertainingly. Why can&#8217;t a design pattern also be a ripping good yarn?</p>
<p>Finally, the designer in me thinks we should maybe take a little of our own medicine here. Design patterns are primarily tools for designers, and we should design them accordingly. One of the things that impressed me with the Yahoo pattern group&#8217;s work is that they worked in some good design methodlogies when building the library—I&#8217;d love to see more work along those lines. Does anyone know of other examples of user testing for our pattern libraries?</p>

<p>This is the fourth part of a five-part series on communicating design patterns. Martijn van Welie lives in the beautiful city of Amsterdam and has been writing interaction design patterns for a number of years. You can also read an earlier five-part conversation on <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?347">What are Design Patterns?</a></p>

<p>Patterns communicate design solutions. Jenifer states that they communicate from &#8220;one designer to another&#8221;. Although this may be true, it may also be from designer to software developer or even to a client. As in any design problem you need to know your audience! What I have learned is that for all audiences the illustrations and examples are the most important element. They support the task of browsing through the collection for ideas and to understand in one glance what the pattern is about.</p>
<p>In the past people in the &#8220;pattern-enthusiasts-community&#8221; have long debated the structure and form of patterns. Jenifer and I have both taken a &#8216;liberal&#8217; path and changed our formats several times over time when it seemed appropriate. What most patterns nowadays share is that they all try to answer the questions of &#8220;What?&#8221;, &#8220;Why?&#8221;, &#8220;When?&#8221; and &#8220;How?. And that is the most important thing of all.</p>
<p>Recently I have experimented with building a bridge to technical aspects of the patterns. This work has done with Eelke Folmer who was doing his Ph.D. on Software Architecture at the time. See the <a href="http://www.welie.com/eelke/undo.html">Multi-level Undo</a> and <a href="http://www.welie.com/eelke/wizard.html">Wizard</a> patterns for some examples. The main idea was that we tried to add software architecture information to a pattern rather than actual code. Adding code always leads to the issue that you have to choose some particular language and assume a certain technical environment. At Yahoo!, Bill is handing out code examples and I can see the difficulty there on how to do this in a handy way.</p>
<p>What is of course also tricky is that not every pattern will have a technical solution with it. For example, a pattern like <a href="http://www.welie.com/patterns/showPattern.php?patternID=zebra-table">Alternating Row Colours</a> will not have a technical solution to go with it. Neither does the <a href="http://www.welie.com/patterns/showPattern.php?patternID=tabbing">Tabs</a> or the <a href="http://www.welie.com/patterns/showPattern.php?patternID=product-page">Product Page</a> pattern.</p>
<p>From my experience writing patterns is really difficult. The difficulty is in deciding what the problem really is and why/when the solution works. Like Jenifer says, &#8220;it is difficult avoiding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_%28rhetoric%29">tautologies</a>.&#8221; Even in my own patterns the problem statements should be improved. </p>
<p>Once a collection of patterns starts to contain more than, say 50 patterns, it becomes more and more relevant to link them all together. The reasons for linking can vary: some patterns solve similar problems, or they often are used together or one pattern is actually part of another pattern, and so on. In my collection the links are gradually being added so that a network of patterns is starting to appear. But what then happens is that you discover than you need to tweak your patterns again and refine the problem statement and the <em>use when</em> sections so that it makes full sense again.</p>
<p>One interesting development in Bill&#8217;s collection is that he <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2005/05/mind-mapping-design-patterns.html">distinguishes between two kinds of problems</a>. One category is &#8220;user problems&#8221; and the other is &#8220;application problems&#8221;. The user problems are the kind of problems that are easily linked to user needs while the application problems mainly make the user experience better without being linked to a specific user task. I always tried to write patterns related to user problems but I got stuck with some of them. I think Bill’s approach solves the issue very well and I hope this can be a new insight that we can all benefit from.</p>
<p>All in all, I have the feeling we are all converging in the format we use. What now becomes a very interesting issue is how we can link all the patterns together and form one large pattern language. Let&#8217;s see how it can be done.</p>
