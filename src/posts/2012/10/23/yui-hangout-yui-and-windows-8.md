![](/yuiblog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dribbble_app-300x225.png "dribbble_app") Come and hang out with the YUI Team on **Tuesday, October 30th at 1pm PST** as we talk about building native apps for Windows 8 using JavaScript. Here's what we'll be covering:

-   Set up your environment and include YUI in your WinJS project.
-   Look over code for a demo WinJS app called Dribbble.
-   Talk about WinJS UI pros and cons.
-   Share what we've learned. (We're still very new to this environment!)
