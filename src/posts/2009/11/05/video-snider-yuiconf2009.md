[Matt Snider](http://mattsnider.com/) is the lead fronted engineer (and employee #1) at Mint.com, the popular personal-finance site that was recently acquired by Intuit. Matt has been a longtime user of YUI at Mint, and he's documented his own additions to YUI extensively over the years [on his blog](http://mattsnider.com/). This year, Matt deepened his work with the library by authoring a major new component: [the YUI 2.8.0 Storage Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/storage). Storage provides an HTML 5-like API for client-side storage, using native HTML 5 engines where available and falling back to SWF and Gears as alternatives when a native engine isn't available.

Matt came to [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) last week to share his work with attendees in a session entitled "[Introducing the YUI 2.8.0 Storage Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=snider-yuiconf2009-storage)." It's a great talk, and one you'll want to watch if you're thinking of adding client-side storage to your project.
