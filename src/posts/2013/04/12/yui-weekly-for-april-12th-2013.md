_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   This week saw the release of **YUI 3.10PR1**, a preview release focusing mostly on low-level performance in [Attribute](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/attribute/), [Base](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/base/), and [EventTarget](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/event-custom/index.html), and also includes [Y.Tree](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tree/) improvements. Also notable, this is also the first release built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). For all the details about the release, check out the [release announcement](/yuiblog/blog/2013/04/08/yui-3-10pr1/), as well as the [full comparison](https://github.com/yui/yui3/compare/v3.9.1...v3.10.0pr1) of changes. For specifics on the performance improvements, take a look at Eric Ferraiuolo's ["YUI 3.10.0 - Go Fast"](https://speakerdeck.com/ericf/yui-3-dot-10-dot-0-go-fast) presentation from last night's After Hours event.
    
-   Last night the YUI Team hosted [YUI After Hours](/yuiblog/blog/2013/04/10/yui-after-hours-tomorrow/) at Yahoo!'s Sunnyvale headquarters. Because it's been a while since [YUIConf 2012](http://lanyrd.com/2012/yuiconf/), the team figured it would be nice to get contributors and the community together for pizza, beer, and presentations. Talks consisted of organization updates from Dav Glass (more on those below), Eric's 3.10 performance overview, Tilo Mitra ([@tilomitra](http://twitter.com/tilomitra)) previewed an upcoming YUI CSS project, Ryan Grove ([@yaypie](https://twitter.com/yaypie)) on [Y.Tree](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tree/) and various SmugMug [Gallery components](https://github.com/smugmug/yui-gallery/tree/master/), and Luke Smith ([@ls\_n](https://twitter.com/ls_n)) on Promises ([Y.Promise](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/promise/)). You can find a video of the event [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj5r6tEL4nM). _(Apologies for the poor audio quality)_.
    
-   Announced at last night's event were a few organizational updates. We're really excited to announce that long-time contributor Caridy Patino ([@caridy](https://twitter.com/caridy)) has officially [joined the YUI team](/yuiblog/blog/2013/04/11/welcome-caridy-patino-to-the-yui-team/) at Yahoo! Congratulations to Luke Smith and Ryan Grove of [SmugMug](http://smugmug.com) on their promotion to [Reviewer status](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model#24-reviewers), as well as Juan Dopazo ([@juandopazo](https://twitter.com/juandopazo)) on his promotion to [Committer status](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model#23-committers). The YUI project now has externals (aka: non-Yahoos) at every level of the [Contributor Model](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model)! In bittersweet news, congratulations to Dav Glass ([@davglass](http://twitter.com/davglass)) on his [new position](http://davglass.tumblr.com/post/46764034078/doing-new-things-and-why-thats-good-for-yui) as a Nodejs architect at Yahoo! While the project will miss his tireless contributions and involvement, having a YUI advocate in an architect role at Yahoo! will be valuable for the future of the project and JavaScript's role at the company.
    
-   This week’s Open Roundtable discussion ([YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGetNcDL98)) featured discussion about the latest ECMAScript meetings, [ES6 modules](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules), and pull requests. See Rick Waldron's ([tc39-notes repository](https://github.com/rwldrn/tc39-notes)) for transcripts of all the ECMAScript meetings.
    
-   [PrettyPages](https://github.com/tilomitra/prettypages/) is a side-project by Tilo Mitra ([@tilomitra](https://twitter.com/tilomitra)) for creating simple and responsive GitHub pages using [YUI CSS](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/css/).
    
-   This week Luke presented his event-system rearchitecture called "eventx". You can catch that video over on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVC-8EGoOuc), and check out his [`yui3-eventx` branch](https://github.com/lsmith/yui3-eventx).
    
-   [YUI Modules Explorer](/yuiblog/blog/2013/04/10/introducing-the-yui-modules-explorer/) is a Nodejs application created by Iliyan Peychev ([@ipeychev](https://twitter.com/ipeychev)) that automatically discovers the required modules for YUI based projects. Neat!
    
-   This week on the [yui-contrib mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/yui-contrib), Satyam discussed his latest [datatable cell editor](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/yui-contrib/zW9UNPmui7k/hII-qNQj0PkJ) updates, and the YUI community [voted to deprecate](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/vhogQJnwuzo) [profiler](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/profiler/) ([#609](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/609/)).
    
-   New and updated [Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) modules include: [advanced-date-format](https://github.com/ashiksmd/i18n-formats/tree/master/src/gallery-advanced-date-format), [advanced-date-timezone](https://github.com/ashiksmd/i18n-formats/tree/master/src/gallery-advanced-timezone), [advanced-number-format](https://github.com/ashiksmd/i18n-formats/tree/master/src/gallery-advanced-number-format), [bottle](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/bottle), [itsadatetimepicker](http://github.com/ItsAsbreuk/yui3-gallery/tree/master/src/gallery-itsadatetimepicker), [itsascrollviewkeynav](http://github.com/ItsAsbreuk/yui3-gallery/tree/master/src/gallery-itsascrollviewkeynav), [list-format](http://github.com/ashiksmd/i18n-formats/tree/master/src/gallery-list-format), [message-format](http://github.com/ashiksmd/i18n-formats/tree/master/src/gallery-message-format), and [yqlmock](http://github.com/luchenghan/yqlmock/tree/master/src/gallery-yqlmock).
