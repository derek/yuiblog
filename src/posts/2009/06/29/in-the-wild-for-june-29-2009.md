The big news from the YUI team last week was [the release of YUI 3.0.0 beta 1](/yuiblog/blog/2009/06/24/yui3b1/), moving YUI 3 one important step closer to GA. What follows is some of the other news coming from the YUI community over the past few weeks. As always, please use the comments section to let us know what we've missed.

-   **[Timr -- a New Timetracking Web-app with Significant YUI Elements](http://timr.com):** Thomas Einwaller wrote in to tell us about [Timr](http://timr.com/), a new time-tracking web application with a slick, rich, YUI-intensive interface including Panels, DataTables and much more. If your job requires you to track time-on-tasks, and you want a web-based system with support for mobile, check out Thomas's project at [Timr.com](http://timr.com/).

-   **[How Happy is Dav? Harley-Davidson Using YUI](http://www.harley-davidson.com):** If you know YUI engineer [Dav Glass](http://davglass.com/), it will not surprise you to learn that he's the one who discovered that [YUI is in use on the Harley-Davidson website](http://www.harley-davidson.com).  Check out their Harley-themed [YUI AutoComplete](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/) in the main search box at the top of the page.

-   **[Ara Pehlivanian on YUI 3 -- New SitePoint Article](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/yui-3-whats-new/):** Ara, coauthor of [a couple of excellent JS tomes](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=Ara%20Pehlivanian&index=books-ca), provides [a nice introduction](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/yui-3-whats-new/) to [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/) and his take on why it might be of interest to developers.  His conclusion: "YUI 3 is a completely different animal than its predecessor. Along with a new syntax, you gain a faster, lighter, easier, and more flexible library—ready to take on your most ambitious web projects."  [Check out the full article for more](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/yui-3-whats-new/).

-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/ibmcss-20090626-082441.jpg)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/wa-htmlcss/index.html)**[IBM DeveloperWorks: "Weaving a Better Web Page with YUI CSS"](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/wa-htmlcss/index.html):** From Martin Streicher, writing for IBM DeveloperWorks, who covers both Blueprint and YUI in this article: "YUI Grids provide CSS for both fixed-width pages and fluid-width pages, and it provides for arbitrarily deep nesting of columns. You can also position and move columns arbitrarily, so you can quickly and simply reorder the content on the page with CSS. For instance, you can move navigation from left to right with one CSS change. Further, you can augment YUI Grids with Yahoo's own JavaScript library to add interactivity. You can read more about the YUI JavaScript library separately. This article focuses on Grids' stylesheets, which can work independent of a JavaScript library."  The article is free online and [available as a PDF](http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/web/wa-htmlcss/wa-htmlcss-pdf.pdf).

-   **[Detecting if the User is Idle with JavaScript and YUI 3](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/06/02/detecting-if-the-user-is-idle-with-javascript-and-yui-3/):** From YUI contributor Nicholas C. Zakas: "Web developers have been interested in whether or not a user is idle since the Ajax explosion hit. With the introduction of more dynamic, highly interactive web interfaces came the desire to know if the user was actually doing anything at any point in time. Thus, the quest for determining if the user is idle began."  [Read on](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/06/02/detecting-if-the-user-is-idle-with-javascript-and-yui-3/) for full details on his blog.

-   **[Matt Snider on Using YUI EventProvider and Custom Events](http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/framework-yui-using-eventprovider/):** Matt Snider, lead frontend on [Mint.com](http://mint.com/) and author of the upcoming YUI Storage Utility, [blogs](http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/framework-yui-using-eventprovider/) about [Adam Moore's YUI Event Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/) components including Custom Events and EventProvider: "By using \[the EventProvider\] interface, developers no longer need to worry about whether or not a given CustomEvent exists when subscribing to it. Thereby, making coding easier, while allowing a developer the opportunity to not create CustomEvents that never fire. Additionally, EventProvider normalizes interactions with CustomEvents attached to objects, since the same methods will be attached to each object. Lastly, the events are bound to the augmented object, so although you might instantiate hundreds of EventProvider augmented object, each sharing an event named ‘update’, only the callback functions subscribed to the current object will execute when the ‘fireEvent’ function of that object is called. In summary, when using EventProvider the event names need only be unique on a single object, not across all objects (as with CustomEvent)." The [full article](http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/framework-yui-using-eventprovider/) is on Matt's blog.

-   **[Eric Ferraiuolo's Facebook-style Overlay in YUI 3 & CSS 3](http://925html.com/code/facebook-style-overlay-in-yui-3-css-3/):** Writes Eric: "While wandering-around the Internet looking for examples of _overlays_ in web application interfaces I thought of a challenge: _create a working Facebook–styled overlay_. I’m in the process of creating an application-wide design for overlays and needed some inspiration. Facebook uses overlays extensively and they have a distinct style \[that others imitate, maybe even me ![:-)](http://925html.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) \]; I set-out to re-create _this style_.  Not wanting to mess around — I whipped up [a working example of Facebook-styled overlays](http://925html.com/files/fb_overlay/) using **only** YUI 3 and CSS 3; things are nice and easy to do when you use the latest technologies."  [Check out his blog post for the full story](http://925html.com/code/facebook-style-overlay-in-yui-3-css-3/).

With the ChartsAjax class, all the chart options can be set with JSON data built dynamically on the server and retrieved from one AJAX call. This includes not only data for the datastore but also styling and column definitions."  [Check out the blogpost on Dayshift](http://www.dayshift.org/2009/06/generic-yui-chart-class.html) for the full example code.
