_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   This week saw the introduction of two patch releases to **YUI 3.10**. First up was **YUI 3.10.2**, a [scheduled release](/yuiblog/blog/2013/06/04/yui-3-10-2-released/) to mark the conclusion of [Sprint 7](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#sprint-7-3102), which includes a variety of bug fixes and stability enhancements for over a dozen components, including [Attribute](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/attribute/), [Charts](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/charts/), [Widget](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/widget/), and more. The [second release](/yuiblog/blog/2013/06/06/yui-3-10-3-released-to-fix-reintroduced-swf-vulnerability/) this week was **YUI 3.10.3**, an unscheduled patch release to resolve a [security vulnerability](/yuiblog/blog/2013/05/14/yui-3-10-1-released-to-fix-swf-vulnerability/) that was previously addressed, but snuck itself back into the source tree. While all distributions of **3.10.2** are now patched, we encourage everyone to upgrade straight to **3.10.3**.
    
-   Moving forward, today the team [announced](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/g1Eq6qq05Ko) the [Sprint 8 development schedule](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#sprint-8-current). A few important deadlines to note are the pull request deadlines. The first being on **June 30th** for any new feature additions and the second being on **July 9th** for any final contributions to the release. The next release is scheduled to occur on **July 16th**.
    
-   At this week's [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable), discussion topics included the [deprecation of SimpleYUI](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/yui-contrib/kPIWkENg_DY/B1-obZQvjiEJ), [Bower](http://bower.io/), Square's [es6-module-transpiler](https://github.com/square/es6-module-transpiler), blue sky discussions about YUI components, and more. It was a fruitful, forward-looking discussion, but unfortunately due to an unexpected problem with Hangouts On Air, it was not recorded. In the future, we'll have a backup plan in place to at minimum record audio of the Hangout.
    
-   In "[Testing JavaScript with Yeti and Sauce Labs WebDriver](http://www.okuryu.com/2013/05/31/testing-javascript-yeti-saucelabs-webdriver.html)", YUI contributor Ryuichi Okumura ([@okuryup](https://twitter.com/okuryup)) demonstrates how simple it is to use [Yeti](http://www.yeti.cx/) and [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) to conduct automated cross-browser unit testing. Thanks to Sauce Labs for [the crosspost](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2013/06/guest-post-testing-javascript-with-yeti-and-sauce-labs-webdriver-with-ryuichi-okumura/)!
