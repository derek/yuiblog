[![Crockford on JavaScript](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/crockford-on-javascript-20091222-085250.jpg)](/yuiblog/crockford)

Continuing the [Crockford on JavaScript](/yuiblog/crockford/) lecture series (Videos: [Part One](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockonjs-1), [Part Two](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockonjs-2), [Part Three](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockonjs-3)), Douglas will be presenting Wednesday at Yahoo! headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA. Attendance is free, but seating is limited (a few tickets remain for each of the final shows) — a full schedule including links to RSVP is available on the [event website](/yuiblog/crockford/).

Wednesday's session is entitled **"Episode IV: The Metamorphosis of Ajax."** We hope to see you there.
