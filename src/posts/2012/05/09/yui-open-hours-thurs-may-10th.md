### YUI 3.5.0 Uploader

[Uploader](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/uploader/) was another component that saw a major upgrade in 3.5.0. Of the many changes, one big one was the addition of support for native features in browsers supporting HTML5.

Join us for a discussion with its author, [Allen Rabinovich](https://twitter.com/#!/allenr), in which we'll talk about how Uploader is structured, some of the challenges with modern techniques that needed to be addressed, and what's on the roadmap for upcoming versions.

### Time & Details

We'll be online on **Thursday from 10am to 11am PDT**.

This week, we'll be trying out Google Plus Hangouts on Air, so the audio and video feed will be through G+, and we'll be monitoring chat in [the #yui IRC channel on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net).
