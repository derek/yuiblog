[![Yahoo! User Interface Library 2.x Cookbook](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/snider-yui2-cookbook-cover-110121.jpg)](http://link.packtpub.com/mHps9c)[Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) is pleased to announce the release of my new book, [_Yahoo! User Interface Library 2.x Cookbook_](http://link.packtpub.com/mHps9c). The book contains numerous coding recipes, providing readers with detailed examples for over twenty-five YUI 2.x components, including [Container](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container), [Drag & Drop](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop), [Connection Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection), [DataTable](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable), [TreeView](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview), and much more.

### What you will learn from this book

I've written this book so that it will help you learn how to use YUI 2.x to build richer, more interactive web applications that impress clients and wow your friends. It has recipes explaining over twenty-five YUI components, showing how to use them, and how to configure them to meet your needs. Each covered component will have extractable code samples that showcase the common ways that the component is used.

Additionally, complete working code can be downloaded separately for each chapter, so it is easier to follow along. For each of the recipes, there is an introductory example, then more advanced examples, followed by an explanation of how the component works and what YUI is doing. For more experienced developers, most recipes also include additional discussion of the solution, explaining how to further customize and enhance the component.

Practical and packed with easy-to-follow recipes, the book will help you create modern, rich internet applications using the most powerful components of Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI).

### Who this book is written for

The book is best suited for JavaScript developers who are relatively new to YUI 2 or interested in getting started quickly. However, it contains examples for almost every component and is equally suited as a reference for experienced developers looking to brush up on or explore some of the most powerful features of each component.
