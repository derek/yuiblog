[Nate Koechley](http://nate.koechley.com/blog/) is the author of the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/)'s CSS components — [Reset](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/), [Fonts](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/), [Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/), and [Base](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/base/). Nate has been at Yahoo since 2001 where he was among the first pure web developers. During the past six years, he's helped guide the formation of a vibrant frontend discipline at Yahoo built around a commitment to professionalism, standards, and performance. In 2005, Nate was among the first engineers to join the YUI team and he was instrumental in making YUI available as a free open-source project in 2006. In addition to engineering our CSS components, Nate has been one of our most visible contributors at conferences, where he's spokeon on a wide range of frontend engineering topics.

In this 40-minute presentation, Nate takes you on a detailed tour of the YUI CSS foundation, its philosophy, and its usage.
