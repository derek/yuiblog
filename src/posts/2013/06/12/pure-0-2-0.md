_[Pure](http://purecss.io) is a set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project._

Two weeks after its initial launch, we're releasing the next version of [Pure](http://purecss.io)! With Pure 0.2.0, we set out to fix some low-level `:focus` issues across the library, along with improving the developer workflow. Most of the components within Pure also received some love. Start using the latest version from the CDN by dropping this `link` tag on your page:

```

<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/pure/0.2.0/pure-min.css">

```

Check out the [Updates page](http://purecss.io/updates/) on the [Pure website](http://purecss.io) for more information on this release. You can also check out the [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/yui/pure/blob/master/HISTORY.md) on [GitHub](http://github.com/yui/pure/).

We'd also like to thank the community for their help in filing bugs, issuing pull requests, and referring Pure. I'd like to give a shout-out to [@dannytatom](https://github.com/dannytatom), [@rcbdev](https://github.com/rcbdev), [@codepb](https://github.com/codepb), and [@mseri](https://github.com/mseri), whose pull requests were merged and included in this release. We're super excited to see you guys using Pure in your projects, and are looking forward to building it out with you.
