_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   With YUI 3.10 out the door last week, the project now shifts its focus towards the next release of YUI. A [tentative schedule](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#wiki-next-release) has been posted on the wiki, which includes a release date on June 4th. Also, this is the first development cycle since the migration to [Github Issues](https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues), so for a detailed view of everything going into the next release, check out the tickets for the [Sprint 7 milestone](https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues?milestone=6&state=open).
    
-   YUI's [Target Environment Matrix](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/environments/) was [updated](/yuiblog/blog/2013/04/26/yui-target-environments-update/) to include Node 0.10.†, and drop Android 2.2, iOS 4.†, Node.js 0.4.†, and Node.js 0.6.†.
    
-   In this week's [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Roundtable-Topics) ([Notes](https://gist.github.com/triptych/5511846), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozRumJm4QcI)), we discussed combo URLs, coding styles and best practices, linting ([yui-lint](https://github.com/yui/yui-lint)), and [pull requests](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pulls).
    
-   Activity on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/yui-contrib) this week included discussion about [latency compensation](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/7v8eAz2kQJI) and [a style guide](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/8FNAf3wf-v8), which led to the creation of the soon-to-be-populated [Best Practices for Writing Code](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Best-Practices-for-Writing-Code) page on the wiki.
    
-   Updated [Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) modules include: [alea](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/alea), [any-base-converter](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/any-base-converter), [array-iterate](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/array-iterate), [array-unnest](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/array-unnest), [composite-image](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/composite-image), [composite-image-canvas](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/composite-image-canvas), [composite-image-pixel](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/composite-image-pixel), [composite-image-pixels](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/composite-image-pixels), [datetime-utils](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datetime-utils), [itsaviewmodel](https://github.com/ItsAsbreuk/yui3-gallery/tree/master/src/gallery-itsaviewmodel), [model-list-difference](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/model-list-difference), [nmmenus](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/nmmenus), and [weighted-list](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/weighted-list).
    
-   New in the Gallery is [lazy-promise](https://github.com/solmsted/yui3-gallery-2/tree/master/src/gallery-lazy-promise), a promise implementation that does not execute until the first time its then method is called.
