_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, leave a comment below or email contributions to [weekly@yuilibrary.com](mailto:weekly@yuilibrary.com)._

-   With [3.8.0 out the door](/yuiblog/blog/2012/12/12/yui-3-8-0-y-color-templates-and-more/), if you are curious about what's next head over to the [YUI wiki](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#wiki-next-release) where you can always find the latest details on the future releases. Next up, a release on **January 22nd** which will either be a patch release for 3.8 or the first 3.9 release, depending on changes & updates planned. Stay tuned for more details.
    
-   This week, the team [officially launched](/yuiblog/blog/2012/12/21/introducing-the-grid-builder/) the [YUI Resposive Grid Builder](http://yui.github.com/gridbuilder/). If you are unfamiliar with the concept of [responsive web design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) it is _"an approach to web design in which a site is crafted to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices"_. Now, with the YUI Responsive Grid Builder, you can quickly and easily create a layout for your site that will work properly across high resolution desktop browsers all the way down to low-resolution mobile devices. RGB is an open-source project, so we encourage you to check out the [source on Github](https://github.com/yui/gridbuilder), play with the [examples](http://yui.github.com/gridbuilder/examples/magazine/), and review the [documentation](http://yui.github.com/gridbuilder/docs.html). An [internet high five](http://www.ihighfive.com/) to Tilo Mitra ([@tilomitra](https://twitter.com/tilomitra)) for the development on this project.
    
-   Ryan Grove ([@yaypie](https://twitter.com/yaypie)) and the SmugMug team released a [TreeView component](https://github.com/smugmug/yui-gallery/tree/master/src/sm-treeview), which will be available in the Gallery in the coming weeks. It even comes complete with [API Docs](http://smugmug.github.com/yui-gallery/api/modules/gallery-sm-treeview.html), a [performance stress test](http://jsbin.com/udayaz/52/), and a [YUI TreeView "Shootout"](http://jsperf.com/yui-treeview/3). Nice work!
    
-   In this week’s YUI Open Roundtable we demonstrated some of the latest developments with [Yeti](http://yeti.cx), discussed [mjata.js](/yuiblog/blog/2012/12/17/yuiconf-2012-talk-mjata-js-bring-data-models-to-life-by-lingyan-zhu/), and reviewed pull requests [#139](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/139), [#48](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/48), and [#320](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/320).
