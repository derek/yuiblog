_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   Work continues on Sprint 9, which is slated to [release](https://github.com/yui/yui3/releases) on August 27th. Remember that [the deadline for submitting pull requests](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contribution-Standards#important-milestones) for this sprint is August 11th.
    
-   Patrick - one of our awesome interns - did some work on [tweets.yuilibrary.com](http://tweets.yuilibrary.com/) this week. That site is back up and is highlighting tweets about the library. Check it out and help out the classifier by up-voting relevant tweets.
    
-   In release news, we launched a [new blog](http://blog.purecss.io/) for [Pure](http://purecss.io/). Subsequent news and updates regarding the Pure project will be posted there, so be sure to subscribe to it. If you're using Pure in a project and are interested in writing a post about it, you can [get in touch with the team](http://blog.purecss.io/submit/) and submit a guest post.
    
-   An awesome set of video tutorials popped up on TechPro earlier this week. It's titled [YUI 3: The complete guide](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1437/yui3-the-complete-guide-widgets-1-lesson-1), and consists of 6 short-length screencasts that introduce you to the library. It's definitely worth a look if you're new to YUI.
