Thanks to everyone who came out to [YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/) last week! It was a jam-packed three days of learning, sharing, and being excited by all the great work being done in the YUI community.

We hosted over 200 attendees from all the over the world (Prague! Sydney! Recife! Chico!) who enjoyed 34 technical sessions, an invigorating panel discussion, an informal show-and-tell, a uniquely memorable Douglas Crockford keynote, and one _very_ popular hands-on introductory workshop led by our own [Allen Rabinovich](http://www.allenrabinovich.com/ "Allen Rabinovich | Yahoo! Flash Platform Engineer") and [Luke Smith](http://lucassmith.name/ "ls.n").

Many attendees took photographs (check out [the YUIConf tag on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/yuiconf/ "Flickr: ")); we've been enjoying [David Calhoun](http://www.flickr.com/photos/franksvalli/sets/72157625231507497/ "YUIConf 2010 - a set on Flickr") and [Reid Burke](http://www.flickr.com/photos/uberlife/sets/72157625212583045/ "YUIConf 2010 - a set on Flickr")'s photostreams in particular.

We're hard at work now processing videos from the conference, and we'll post them to [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/ "YUI Theater") as soon as they become available. You can expect to watch gems like Luke's [_YUI 3: Below the Surface_](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/schedule.php#below), [_A Whirlwind Tour of AlloyUI Components in the YUI 3 Gallery_](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/schedule.php#alloyui-tour "YUIConf 2010 Schedule") by Nate Cavanaugh and Eduardo Lundgren, and [_CSS 3 Beyond the Hype_](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/schedule.php#css3) by Nicole Sullivan. In the meantime we'll be posting the links to the slide decks at [http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/schedule.php](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/schedule.php).
