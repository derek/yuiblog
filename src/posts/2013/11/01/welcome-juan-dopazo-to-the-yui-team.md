We are pleased to announce the addition of Juan Dopazo to the YUI Team!

Here's a little introduction from Juan:

> "I've been a total web and JavaScript geek for years. I've worked at large companies with 20k employees and at 3-person startups. I've worked on such diverse projects as writing code that delivered ads in websites. Now I'm really happy to be working on open source projects. The members of the YUI team have been my long distance mentors and friends, so I'm thrilled to join them at Yahoo to take YUI and Mojito to the next level. The same goes for the YUI community! I'm very happy to be able to help from the inside now."

Juan's into volleyball, cycling, and is a Bioware fan. Welcome Juan!
