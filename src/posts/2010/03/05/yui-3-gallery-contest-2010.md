We're pleased to announce the [YUI 3 Gallery Contest 2010](/yuiblog/yui3gallerycontest2010/ "YUI 3 Gallery Contest 2010"). Thanks to our friends at the [Yahoo! Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.com/ "Yahoo! Developer Network Home"), we have a conference pass to the sold-out [JSConf 2010](http://jsconf.us/2010/ "JSConf.US 2010 -- Swashbucklin' JavaScript!") to offer. We're pairing that with a $500 gift certificate to [Expedia.com](http://www.expedia.com/ "Expedia Travel: Airline Tickets, Hotels, Car Rental, Airfares, & Vacations") to help the prize winner get back and forth to Virginia for the conference.

The prize will go to the person who authors the best new [YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/ "YUI Library :: Gallery") module between March 5 and March 22 and submits it for community use under [YUI's BSD license](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html "YUI Software License"). As with any contest, there are lots of rules. We've noted some of the big ones [on the contest page](/yuiblog/yui3gallerycontest2010 "YUI 3 Gallery Contest 2010") and you can [read the full legal writeup here](/yuiblog/yui3gallerycontest2010/yui3gallery2010.pdf).

We're thrilled with what we all as a community have done since late 2009 to make the Gallery a hotbed for [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/ "YUI 3 — Yahoo! User Interface Library") growth and innovation. [Greg Hinch's Form module](/yuiblog/blog/2009/12/03/yui-3-gallery-form-module/ "The YUI 3 Form Module — Forms and Validation Made Simple » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)") (submitted hours after the Gallery opened), Ryan Grove's excellent [Storage](/yuiblog/blog/2010/02/23/gallery-storage-lite/ "In the YUI 3 Gallery: Ryan Grove’s Storage Lite Cross-Browser Storage Library » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)") and [History](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/history-lite "YUI Library :: Gallery :: History Lite") modules, [Ilyan Peychev's über-popular Accordion](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/accordion "YUI Library :: Gallery :: Accordion"), [Julien Lecomte's SimpleMenu](/yuiblog/blog/2010/02/12/gallery-simple-menu/ "In the YUI 3 Gallery: Julien Lecomte’s 1.3KB SimpleMenu with Keyboard and ARIA Support » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)"), [Stephen Woods's Timepicker](/yuiblog/blog/2010/03/03/gallery-timepicker/ "In the YUI 3 Gallery: Stephen Woods’ TimePicker Module » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)"), [Adam Moore's TreeView](/yuiblog/blog/2010/02/18/gallery-treeview-port/ "In the YUI 3 Gallery: Adam Moore’s YUI TreeView Port » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)"), [Jeff Craig's Chromahash](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/chromahash "YUI Library :: Gallery :: chromahash"), Dav's own [YQL module](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/yql "YUI Library :: Gallery :: YQL Query")...and dozens more.

We hope you'll consider doing some YUI 3 hacking over the next few weeks to add to this collection. We've listed some resources on the contest page, and there's [a forum thread going with ideas for new modules](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=115&t=2915&start=0) (please weigh in there even if you're not going to be writing a module for the contest yourself). And, of course, [the current Gallery is a good source of inspiration](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/?show=all "YUI Library :: Gallery").

Happy hacking, and we're looking forward to seeing a YUI Gallery author head out to JSConf next month!
