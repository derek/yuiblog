In this talk from YUIConf 2011, Jeff Burtoft ([@boyofgreen](http://twitter.com/boyofgreen)), Lead Frontend Engineer at [USAA](http://www.usaa.com/), shares what he's learned about building performant and scalable cross-platform mobile web apps using YUI. In the course of the talk, Jeff reveals some of the pitfalls of dealing with device limitations -- particularly when building native-wrapped web apps that run in web views -- and explains how he and his team worked around them using YUI.
