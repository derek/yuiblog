In this talk from YUIConf 2011, YUI engineer Allen Rabinovich ([@allenr](https://twitter.com/allenr)) shares the process he used to architect and build the new [Calendar widget](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/calendar/) in YUI 3, and explains how you can use a similar process to build your own widgets. He also shows off the new component and reveals a clever performance trick used to speed up the rendering of multiple calendars.
