The next YUI: Open Hours will be this Thursday, Feb 17th.

### Implementation focus: fanity.com

You may be familiar with Yvo Schaap's work from [this "In the Wild" post](/yuiblog/2009/03/25/wild-20090325/#yuiBlogWild-219) from 2009. He's been working with YUI for years now, and has made the switch to YUI 3 with his latest site [fanity.com](http://fanity.com).[![fanity.com home page](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fanity.jpg)](http://fanity.com)

Give it a whirl with the guest account (email: guest@fanity.com password: fanity).

Eric F, Ryan Grove, and I will have Yvo on the call to talk about his experience building the site. Some topics we expect to cover:

-   Moving from YUI 2 to YUI 3
-   Choosing YUI
-   Modules, OOP, etc in the YUI environment
-   Linking the backend and frontend
-   The pitfalls he encountered
-   And of course, **let's look at the code!**

One nice detail I'd like to have a look at is their implementation of YUI's new [AutoComplete](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/autocomplete/) widget.[![fanity.com's autocomplete UI](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fanity_autocomplete.jpg)](http://fanity.com)
