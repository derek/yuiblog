We released a minor update to the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) today, fixing more than a dozen bugs across the suite. This brings YUI to version 0.11.3. You can download the update, along with comprehensive release notes, from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/yui). (You can read more about what was new for the last major release, 0.11 in July, [here on YUIBlog](/yuiblog/blog/2006/07/10/yui-library-release-011-a-host-of-enhancements-and-a-new-logger-control/); our latest [forward-looking roadmap for the YUI Library](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/3804) is available on the Yahoo! Group YDN-JavaScript.)

Along with this release, we're updating our [YUI Cheat Sheets](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/#cheatsheets) and broadening coverage to include additional components. Cheat Sheets are now available for the following YUI utilities and controls:

![Cheat Sheets, like this one for the Slider Control, are condensed one-page documents designed to help you get oriented to and get started with YUI components.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/slider-cheatsheet.gif)-   Animation
-   AutoComplete
-   Calendar
-   Connection Manager
-   Dom
-   Drag & Drop
-   Event
-   Logger
-   Panel
-   Slider
-   TreeView

As always, the latest and greatest Cheat Sheets can be downloaded in PDF format [from the YUI Library website](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/#cheatsheets) over at the Yahoo Developer Network. That's also the best place to go for all the latest YUI documentation — for each component, you'll find [a detailed guide to its use](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/), comprehensive [API documentation](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/autocomplete/), and [a host of examples](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/autocomplete/).
