[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/webdevsolutions-cover.jpg)](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/webdevsolutions.zip)Christian Heilmann and Mark Norman Francis are lead Yahoo! frontend engineers who ply their trade in Yahoo!'s London office in Covent Garden. Both are frequent speakers on the web-developer conference circuit in the UK. Christian blogs at [http://wait-till-i.com](http://wait-till-i.com); Norm writes insighfully (if only occasionally) at [http://cackhanded.net/](http://cackhanded.net/).

Their new book from Friends of Ed (APress) is _[Web Development Solutions: Ajax, APIs, Libraries, and Hosted Services Made Easy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590598067)_. The purpose of new volume was to show to people who want to publish on the web that by using APIs and hosted services it is possible to set up a complex and sophisticated web application without having to reinvent every technical wheel along the way. Here's how Christian explains it:

> Let Flickr worry about the conversion of your photos, del.icio.us allow you to add up-to-date links and Wordpress and its developer community help you pick a template. All you should really worry about is the content you want to offer your visitors.

As is our wont when new books come out with YUI-oriented content, we asked Friends of Ed editor Chris Mills if we might share an excerpt here. He was kind enough to provide a section of the book in which Christian and Norm step through the creation of [hierarchical menus](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/) and the [use of animation](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/) with the YUI library.
