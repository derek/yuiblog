[![Visit Kris's new game at digitalinsane.com.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/cieslak-pacman.png)](http://www.digitalinsane.com/api/yahoo/pacman/)Kris Cieslak is back, after a long break, with a new YUI-based game: [Pacman](http://www.digitalinsane.com/api/yahoo/pacman/). We [last heard from Kris](/yuiblog/blog/2007/02/27/cieslak/) about 18 months ago, when he was showing off [Yetris](http://www.digitalinsane.com/api/yahoo/yetris/), [Puzzle](http://www.digitalinsane.com/api/yahoo/puzzle/) and [Solitaire](http://www.digitalinsane.com/api/yahoo/solitaire/). Now Kris returns with another classic game built entirely in JavaScript, bolstered by YUI 2.5.2's core (Yahoo, Dom and Event). [Check it out](http://www.digitalinsane.com/api/yahoo/pacman/) and [give Kris feedback on his blog](http://www.digitalinsane.com/archives/2008/08/30/pacman/).
