Allen Rabinovich spoke at [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) last month about the future of the [YUI Charts](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/) project. He and colleague Tripp Bridges are hard at work on the next generation of the product, and in this session Allen talks through the thinking behind the new architecture and what we can expect as the YUI 3 version comes to fruition.
