[![Shawn Lawton Henry of the W3C](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/shawnhenry.jpg)](http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=955300)Lots of the work in technology that we do is based on standards. In the Web world many standards such as HTML, CSS and many more have been produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). [Shawn Lawton Henry](http://www.w3.org/People/Shawn/) gave us an update on the standards produced by W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative at Yahoo's European headquarters in London. Where the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 are very precise and contain a number of technical requirements that might be outdated, WCAG 2.0 takes a different approach. WCAG 2.0 takes a much more user-oriented approach. In her presentation, Shawn looks at the changes to WCAG as well as some of the other Accessibility standards produced by the W3C. Most of all she asks "how can I build more accessible sites?" so we can make the web a more friendly place.

A [transcript of Shawn's presentation](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200706wcag2pres) is available on the WAI website. Many thanks to Shawn for allowing us to record the session and share it [on YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/).
