						<h2 id="post-271"><a href="/yuiblog/blog/2008/11/11/frontpage-and-yui3/">The New Yahoo! Front Page and YUI 3.0</a></h2>
					

						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="http://ycorpblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/metro.jpg" alt="The new Yahoo! Front Page."></p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Front Page</a> team embarked on an ambitious project to completely remake the face of the company. The goal was to make the Front Page into the most important starting point on the web while also showcasing Yahoo!&#8217;s commitment to openness. From the engineering team&#8217;s perspective, this meant turning the Front Page into a framework upon which Yahoo! and its partners could build new functionality and experiences rapidly.</p>
<p>Thinking of the Front Page as an application framework led us down some very creative paths. On the front end, we quickly came to the conclusion that a JavaScript framework would have to be developed to run the page. Steve Carlson, my colleague and partner-in-crime on Front Page, and I then spent weeks hashing through use cases, developer needs, and design patterns. Instead of starting from scratch, we decided to start with the YUI 2.x-based framework we had used on <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">My Yahoo!</a> and evolve it into a more complete solution. After reviews with various architects and stakeholders, we had a working design that we could implement. The only question left was which library to build the new framework on.</p>
<p>The natural approach for building new JavaScript frameworks at Yahoo! is to start with YUI as a base, and that has typically meant the 2.x version. As an adjunct member of the YUI team, however, I was privy to some information surrounding the development of YUI 3. It turned out that YUI 3 was going to be developed simultaneous to our development of the new Front Page. I sat in on several reviews with YUI 3&#8242;s principal architects Adam Moore and Matt Sweeney, talking through some of their plans for the library. Their departure from the approach used for the 1.x and 2.x releases of the library made a lot of sense to me and seemed like a natural fit for what we were doing on the Front Page. Steve and I both felt that building on YUI 3 would make implementing our design much easier based on several goals that we had for the framework:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eliminate global dependencies.</strong> We wanted each part of the page to operate separately from all of the others. Each part should have no knowledge of what else is on the page and therefore can&#8217;t depend on objects to be globally available. The 2.x library is based on the global YAHOO object, which we would have had to abstract away; the 3.x concept of YUI instances that could be individually manipulated worked perfectly to achieve this goal.</li>
<li><strong>Make it small, make it fast.</strong> The Front Page can&#8217;t afford to be slow, so we needed to have as little code as possible to get everything up and running. YUI 3 impressed us with its organization into small, atomic units that allowed us to specifically include parts of the library that we wanted while eliminating parts that were unnecessary. Further, one of the goals of YUI 3 was to optimize for runtime execution and make it faster than the 2.x version. Once again, YUI 3&#8242;s approach was directly in line with the Front Page&#8217;s goals.</li>
<li><strong>Create version independence.</strong> From the start, we didn&#8217;t want to have dependencies on specific versions of YUI components as this can lead to maintenance issues. What we really wanted was for each part of the page to be able to use whatever version of the components that they wanted. The sandboxing feature of YUI 3 opened up the possibility of having two (or more) YUI instances each loading different versions of various components while not interfering with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Allow code portability.</strong> Having worked at Yahoo! for a combined five years, Steve and I knew that anything we put on a Yahoo! property could be a candidate for porting to someplace else. We knew that this possibility meant the code had to stand on its own and not make assumptions about the environment in which it was placed. We thought about the most difficult environment possible: a locked-down browser environment where the JavaScript code has no direct access to the DOM. Since YUI 3 can abstract away the DOM through its Node interface, we had the entrypoint necessary to make this requirement a reality.</li>
<li><strong>Be forward compatible.</strong> The project to create a new Front Page is an incredibly long one and we wanted to be as forward-looking as possible. We knew that if we created the framework on YUI 2.x that we&#8217;d be hard pressed to get time to upgrade later on. By building on YUI 3 from the start, we eliminated the need for developing an upgrade path later on.</li>
</ol>
<p>The YUI 3 story was incredibly compelling to us and was clearly inline with all that we had hoped to achieve in developing the new Front Page. Our recommendation wasn&#8217;t without controversy, however, as YUI 3 was just beginning development. This meant not only was there very little usable code but there was also no documentation. Further, our developers were already familiar with the 2.x version of the library and not at all with the 3.x version. Both teams knew that the only way to make this process work was full cooperation with each other.</p>
<p>We setup weekly check-ins between the Front Page and YUI teams to track progress, bugs, and determine which features from 2.x to port next. In essence, the new Front Page and YUI 3 were developed hand-in-hand in a mutually beneficial relationship. The YUI team provided regular drops of code completely out of their planned release cycle and the Front Page team, in turn, provided feedback on what was and wasn&#8217;t working with developers. There were some growing pains for both teams as that feedback sometimes resulted in interface changes, but ultimately we all knew that this was making both products better.</p>
<p>What began in January 2008 as two separate projects, the new Front Page and YUI 3, has turned into a joint effort to create the best start experience on the web and the best front end library for web developers. With each project informing the other, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://ycorpblog.com/2008/09/17/testing-testing-a-new-yahoo-com/">the new Front Page go into testing</a> and <a href="/yuiblog/blog/2008/08/13/yui3pr1/">the YUI team publish its first preview release of YUI 3.0</a> in the past couple of months. Both represent major steps forward in their respective parts of the company and neither would have been possible without the other.</p>
<p>The Front Page team is proud to have the first site running completely on YUI 3; if it works for us and our strict requirements and scale, we think there&#8217;s a good chance it will work for you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The new Yahoo! Front Page is in bucket testing right now and there&#8217;s no way to self-select into the bucket test.</em></p>

<p>Stuart Grimshaw, Martin Smyllie and Liam Jolly of <a href="http://www.sdl.com/en/">SDL</a> have been integrating YUI into the framework that underlies their enterprise-level Global Information Management products.  As they prepare for the first production deployment of this framework, known internally as the &#8220;Common Enterprise Application Framework&#8221; (CEAF), they took some time to discuss with us how the project is going and how their work with YUI has turned out so far.</p>
</p></div>
<p class="q"><strong>Tell us a little bit about SDL.  What are your core lines of business?</strong></p>
<p>SDL is the world leader in Global Information Management. We provide desktop and enterprise software and  localization services to help corporations create and maintain all multilingual content.  </p>
<p class="q"><strong>What kinds of web applications do you develop at SDL?  What JavaScript frameworks do you use across the spectrum of your projects?</strong></p>
<p>The web applications we develop are for corporate customers who are looking to manage multilingual assets such as terminology, previously translated content, and dictionaries. Most of our enterprise applications have a web front end. For example, <a href="http://www.sdl.com/en/products/global-ams/Global_ams.asp">Global AMS</a> enables a system administrator to manage users and the profiles and rules available to those users. Global AMS is the first SDL application to use CEAF and YUI.</p>
<p>Historically, our other web applications have used our own bespoke JS frameworks written for each application. We haven&#8217;t really used any of the other frameworks.</p>
<p class="q"><strong>YUI is used in your framework (CEAF), which is part of your recently-released <a href="http://www.sdl.com/en/products/global-ams/Global_ams.asp">Global AMS</a> product.  How are you using YUI in these applications?</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to give all our products a similar look and feel so that the user experience is consistent across the whole range of products. YUI helps us by providing a common set of widgets for developers to use.</p>
<p>CEAF allows the developers to specify in the configuration of an application what elements should be available on each page. For example, that a page will have a toolbar with buttons that add new objects to the system and a table with a list of languages which must have a context menu so that users can interact with the data being shown. YUI allows us to easily turn that configuration in to UI that users can interact with. Even the forms that don&#8217;t fit this model are easier because the YUI widgets and the widgets we build on top of them mean the developer can concentrate on what the form is doing rather than how it looks.</p>
<p><img src="/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/sdl-dialog.png" alt="Dialog, Tabs and other YUI controls in use on SDL's Global AMS."></p>
<p>We use the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/dialog">Dialog widget</a> the most. Each object within the system is represented at some point on a YUI-based <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/dialog/">Dialog</a>, either when it&#8217;s being created or edited. It might sound insignificant in that one sentence but most objects can be represented using the default dialog class and very few require anything more than that.</p>
<p>We send the bare minimum HTML to the client until more is requested. Dialog boxes are all loaded on the fly using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection">Connection Manager</a> before being cached if the data would be useful later on.</p>
<p>We use the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/layout/">Layut Manager</a> to build the basic page layout and to give the application a known starting point for all its styles. The page is split into three and we use <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">Connection Manager</a> to load the main page element with data from the server.</p>
<p><img src="/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/sdl-menu.png" alt="The YUI Context Menu in use on SDL's Global AMS."></p>
<p class="q"><strong>Why YUI?  There are lots of good options out there &mdash; what was it about YUI that made it a good fit for these applications?</strong></p>
<p>We also looked quite seriously at Dojo, but in the end YUI ticked more boxes. YUI had better documentation, the weight of Yahoo! behind it and a massive community.</p>
<p>We like the mix of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/">API documentation</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/calendar/quickstart.html">getting-started tutorials</a> and more <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/get/get-script-basic.html">advanced examples</a>. So much so that we&#8217;ve adopted the same model for our developer documentation we do for CEAF.</p>
<p class="q"><strong>What&#8217;s next for you and your web team at SDL?</strong></p>
<p>The release of Global AMS was just the first of our products to use CEAF and we&#8217;re continuing to build other applications on CEAF.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just finished integrating 2.5.2 of the YUI framework, upgrading from version 2.3.1. We can&#8217;t just upgrade to the latest and greatest version of YUI as soon as it&#8217;s available, so this means we&#8217;re a couple of versions out of step. This is why we keep pestering about adding version numbers to the API docs, so we know the method is available in a specific version. This work will also let us switch versions of YUI more easily in the future; we had to customise some of the early widgets (the table in particular) but that&#8217;s no longer the case in 2.5.2.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re adding new widgets of our own to the CEAF framework such as a file upload widget, an implementation of the drag and drop control for personalising data tables and multi-select boxes.</p>

This tutorial, he writes, is &#8220;intended to help users get the most out of the YUI Calendar control. The calendar control is a unique &#8216;widget&#8217; because it is actually a complete &#8216;window&#8217;. That is, it is not an element added in the flow of your page — it is specifically designed to be a &#8216;popup&#8217; element.  What most people find they want to do is have multiple calendar popups on a page, and furthermore, have &#8216;linked&#8217; user input fields for each input. In doing so, it is important to consider the efficiency of the solution, specifically, it is desirable to have a single calendar &#8216;widget&#8217;. This [tutorial shows] you how to accomplish this goal, with a play-by-play commentary on the code that allows this to happen.&#8221;<br /><a href="http://yuihelp.levycodev.com/demos/calendar/multi_cals_on_a_page_help.php"><img src="/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/levy-multical.png" vspace="10"></a></li>

</ul>
<p>This second installment of the image optimization series talks about file formats and how to chose the right one for the job. We&#8217;ll briefly discuss the popular GIF and JPEG formats and then move on to highlighting the rock star, PNG, hopefully helping correct some misconceptions about it.</p>
<h3>GIF</h3>
<p>GIF is a palette (also called &#8220;indexed&#8221;) type of image. It contains a palette of indexed colors, up to 256, and for every pixel of the image there is a corresponding color index. The format is no longer subject to patent issues, so you can create GIFs without the risk of going to jail. (For more on the history of the GIF format, <a href="http://www.cloanto.com/users/mcb/19950127giflzw.html">click here</a>.)</p>
<p>GIF is a <em>non-lossy</em> format, which means that when you modify the image and save it, you don&#8217;t lose quality.</p>
<p>GIF also support animations, which, in the dark Web 1.0 ages, resulted in a plethora of blinking &#8220;new&#8221; images, rotating @ signs, birds dropping &#8230; an email, and other annoyances. In the much more civilized Web 2.0 era, we still have &#8220;loading&#8230;&#8221; animations while we wait for the results of the next Ajax request to update the page, but there are also things like the good old shiny sparkles that people like to put in their social network profiles. Nevertheless, animation support is here if you need it.</p>
<p>GIF also supports transparency, which is a sort of boolean type of transparency. A pixel in a GIF image is either fully transparent or it&#8217;s fully opaque.</p>
<h3>JPEG</h3>
<p>JPEG doesn&#8217;t have the 256 colors restriction associated with GIFs; it can contain millions of colors and it has great compression. This makes it suitable for photos and, in fact, most cameras store photos in JPEG format. It&#8217;s a <em>lossy</em> format, meaning you lose quality with every edit, so it&#8217;s best to store the intermediate results in a different format if you plan to have many edits. There are, however, some operations that can be performed losslessly, such as cropping a part of the image, rotating it or modifying meta information, such as comments stored in the image file.</p>
<p>JPEG doesn&#8217;t support transparency.</p>
<h3>PNG</h3>
<p>PNGs is a <em>non-lossy</em> format that comes in several kinds, but for practical purposes, we can think of PNGs as being of two kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>PNG8, and</li>
<li>truecolor PNGs.</li>
</ol>
<p>PNG8 is a palette image format, just like GIF, and 8 stands for 8 bits, or 2<sup>8</sup>, or 256, the number of palette entries. The terms &#8220;PNG8&#8243;, &#8220;palette PNG&#8221; and &#8220;indexed PNG&#8221; are used interchangeably. </p>
<p>How does PNG8 compare to GIF?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>it usually yields a smaller file size</li>
<li>it supports alpha (variable) transparency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>no animation support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second type of PNGs, truecolor PNGs, can have millions of colors, like JPEG. You can also sometimes come across the names PNG24 or PNG32.</p>
<p>And how does truecolor PNG compare to JPEG? On the pros side, it&#8217;s non-lossy and supports alpha transparency, but on the cons side, the file size is bigger. This makes truecolor PNG an ideal format as an intermediate between several edits of a JPEG and also in cases where every pixel matters and the file size doesn&#8217;t matter much, such as taking screeenshots for a help manual or some printed material.</p>
<h3>Internet Explorer and PNG transparency</h3>
<p>We said that both PNG types support alpha transparency, but there are some browser eccentricities that affect both types and about which you should be aware.</p>
<p>With PNG8, whenever you have semi-transparent pixels they appear as fully transparent in IE (version 6 and lower). This is not ideal but it&#8217;s still useful and is the same behavior that you get from a GIF. So by using a PNG8, in the worst case (IE &lt; 7) you get the same user experience as with a GIF, while for other browsers (Firefox, Safari, Opera) you get a better experience. Below is an example that illustrates this, note how in IE6 the semi-transparent light around the bulb is missing (source: <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/09/18/png8-the-clear-winner/">SitePoint</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/png8-transparency.png" alt="PNG8 alpha transparency" /></p>
<p>For truecolor PNGs, the situation is a much less attractive compromise. All the semi transparent pixels appear grey in IE prior to version 7 (source: <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/inline-alpha.html">W3C</a>).</p>
<p><img src="/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/png-transparency.png" alt="transparency in truecolor PNG" /></p>
<p>IE7 introduces proper native support for alpha transparency in both PNG8 and truecolor PNGs. For earlier IE versions you need to fix the truecolor PNG transparency issue using CSS and an AlphaImageLoader filter, which we&#8217;ll discuss in more details in a follow-up article. (Spoiler alert: <em>avoid AlphaImageLoader</em>.)</p>
<h3>&#8220;All we are saying is: Give PiNG a chance!&#8221;</h3>
<p>Although PNG8 should be the preferred of the PNGs, because it&#8217;s smaller in filesize and degrades well in early IEs without special CSS filters, there are still some use cases for truecolor PNGs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When the 256 colors of the PNG8 are not enough, you may need a truecolor PNG.</strong> This is a case you should try to avoid. On one hand, if you have thousands and thousands of colors, this starts to look like a case where JPEG will be better suited and will give better compression. On the other hand, if the colors are around a thousand or so, you may try to convert this image to a PNG8 and see if it looks acceptable. Very often, the human eye is not sensitive enough to tell the difference between 200 and 1000 colors. That depends on the image, of course; often you can safely remove 1000 colors, but sometimes removing even 2 colors results in an unacceptable image. In any event, try your potential truecolor PNG candidate as PNG8 and as JPEG and see if you like the result in terms of quality and file size.</li>
<li><strong>When most of the image is semi-transparent.</strong> If only a small part of the image is semi-transparent, like around rounded corners, the GIF-like degradation of PNG8 is often OK. But if most of the image is translucent (think a PLAY button over a video thumbnail), you might not have a choice but to use the AlphaImageLoader hack.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Caridy, a leading and always-helpful contributor to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript">YUI community forum</a>, has been working in front of a PC since the nineties. Until recently, he was a professional programmer developing LAMP applications for the University of Las Villas where he received his B.S. in Computer Science in 2003, and for several companies around the world. He recently joined Yahoo and works for Yahoo&#8217;s emerging markets group in Miami.</em></p>
<p><em>For the last two years he&#8217;s been focused on JavaScript as a development platform. Early last year he decided to create an easy-to-adopt YUI extension called &#8220;<a href="http://bubbling-library.com/">Bubbling Library</a>&#8221; as a side project; you can read <a href="/yuiblog/blog/2007/09/13/bubbling-library-by-caridy/">his YUIBlog introduction to the Bubbling Library here</a>.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This article is about my <a href="http://bubbling-library.com/eng/api/docs/plugins/dispatcher">Dispatcher Plugin</a> (part of my <a href="http://www.bubbling-library.com">Bubbling Library</a>) and how to use it along with the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/">YUI TabView</a> to load on-demand content using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">YUI Connection Manager</a>. The Bubbling Library doesn&#8217;t ship with YUI, but it&#8217;s a free download and licensed under the same BSD terms as is YUI.</p>
<h3>YUI TabView Overview</h3>
<p>One of the most compelling components in the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI Library</a> is the TabView Control. It  allows us to maximize the space in our web pages, ordering and segmenting the information and sharing the container (visualization area) at the same time. It&#8217;s easy to use as a developer and as an end user because the navigable tabbed views of content represent a well known design pattern in most OSs. Most users feel comfortable using TabView right away.</p>
<h3>A Few Examples</h3>
<p>One of my favorite characteristics of the YUI widgets is that they can be used to enhance the DOM in an unobtrusive way with little effort. &nbsp;The TabView widget is no exception: </p>
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;demo&quot; class=&quot;yui-navset&quot;&gt;     
  &lt;ul class=&quot;yui-nav&quot;&gt;         
    &lt;li class=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tab1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tab One Label&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tab2&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tab Two Label&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     
  &lt;/ul&gt;                 
  &lt;div class=&quot;yui-content&quot;&gt;         
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tab One Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;         
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tab Two Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; 
var myTabs = new YAHOO.widget.TabView(&quot;demo&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>(<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/tabview/frommarkup.html">Live demo</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/tabview/frommarkup.html"><img src="/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/tabviewexample.png" width="510" height="214" /></a></p>
<p>If Progressive Enhancement isn&#8217;t relevant in your implementation, you can create a TabView object purely from JavaScript, creating the tabs and rendering them into a specified DOM element.  In this case, the content of the tabs will not be available for search engines, which is a drawback, but the content for each tab can be loaded on demand using AJAX or by injecting the HTML code directly during the definition of the tab. Let&#8217;s see an example:</p>
<pre>
var myTabs = new YAHOO.widget.TabView(&quot;demo&quot;);
myTabs.addTab( new YAHOO.widget.Tab({ <br />  label: 'Tab One Label', <br />  content: '&lt;p&gt;Tab One Content&lt;/p&gt;',
  active: true  <br />})); <br />myTabs.addTab( new YAHOO.widget.Tab({ <br />  label: 'Tab Three Label',
  content: '&lt;p&gt;Loading, please wait...&lt;/p&gt;', <br />  dataSrc: 'tab2.html' <br />}));
myTabs.appendTo(document.body);
</pre>
<p>(<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/tabview/fromscript.html">Live demo</a>.)</p>
<p>This technique is mostly used in dynamic web applications. We can also combine the progressively enhanced and dynamic approaches, creating a tabview with the default content from the markup and then inserting the rest of the tabs on the fly. In this case, each tab will load the content using AJAX. Check out this example: </p>
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;demo&quot; class=&quot;yui-navset&quot;&gt;     
  &lt;ul class=&quot;yui-nav&quot;&gt;         
    &lt;li class=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tab1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tab One Label&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    
  &lt;/ul&gt;                 
  &lt;div class=&quot;yui-content&quot;&gt;         
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tab One Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; 
var myTabs = new YAHOO.widget.TabView(&quot;demo&quot;);
var tab2 = new YAHOO.widget.Tab({ <br />  label: 'Tab Two Label', <br />  content: '&lt;p&gt;Loading, please wait...&lt;/p&gt;',
  dataSrc: 'tab2.html'  <br />})
myTabs.addTab( tab2 );<br />myTabs.addTab( new YAHOO.widget.Tab({ <br />  label: 'Tab Three Label', <br />  content: '&lt;p&gt;Tab Three Content&lt;/p&gt;' <br />}));

&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>TabView uses the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">YUI Connection Manager</a> to load the content on demand, and it handles all the AJAX logic under the hood. <em>Keep in mind that the Connection Manager is subjected to the Cross Domain Policy, which means that you can only use URLs within the current domain</em>. (In <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/">YUI 3.0</a>, the successor to Connection Manager, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/io/">the IO Utility</a>, provides Flash-based support for cross-domain AJAX [<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/io/io-xdr.html">demo</a>].)</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to create enhanced functionality within the tab content (when a certain tab becomes active), and for this you can use “<code>contentChange</code>” or “<code>beforeContentChange</code>” events to execute certain actions. We could add this kind of logic to the previous example as follows: </p>
<pre>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;<br />function handleContentChange(e) {  <br />  alert('tab2 was loaded...');
  /* you can render a datatable within the tab now :-) */<br />}<br />tab2.addListener('contentChange', handleContentChange);<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>But this approach can introduce certain dependencies and complexity within our code, because the actions for a certain tab’s content will be defined at the page level, which means that if you want change the content of tab, you probably need to change something at the application level as well &#8212; the functionality of the tab&#8217;s content is not encapsulated with that content.</p>
<p>Creating monolithic contents (on demand content that will encapsulate its own requirements, initialization process and  behaviors) seems be a solution, but there is a problem: If you want load a certain content within a tab, and that content has some JavaScript functionality, that functionality will not be executed because. The tab widget will use innerHTML to replace the tab’s content. The browser will then strip out the “script” tags because it&#8217;s injecting the code within the tab, and that script content will not be executed at all. Generally this is a good thing, as it protects you from one potential vector for XSS attacks. But in the event you need to bring in scripts this way, it&#8217;s a problem you need to work around. (Keep in mind, though, that working around this puts the responsibility for security squarely on your shoulders. Using the event-driven approach described above is a better, more secure approach for applications where it&#8217;s possible to use it.)</p>
<p> If you go down the path of bringing scripts into the page with the content of a tab, the good news is that you can use a plugin to delegate the work, and it will handle the AJAX routine to execute and process the CSS and the JavaScript code within the on demand contents. This plugin, from my <a href="http://www.bubbling-library.com/">Bubbling Library</a>, is called “Dispatcher” (<code>YAHOO.plugin.Dispatcher</code>), and it has been one of the most popular components from my Bubbling Library Extension. </p>
<h3>YUI Dispatcher Plugin</h3>
<p>The complexity of the code will be almost the same as what we&#8217;ve seen above; even the syntax is quite similar. Let&#8217;s start with an example: </p>
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;demo&quot; class=&quot;yui-navset&quot;&gt;     
  &lt;ul class=&quot;yui-nav&quot;&gt;         
    &lt;li class=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tab1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tab One Label&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    
  &lt;/ul&gt;                 
  &lt;div class=&quot;yui-content&quot;&gt;         
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tab One Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
var myTabs = new YAHOO.widget.TabView(&quot;demo&quot;);<br /><em>YAHOO.plugin.Dispatcher.delegate (new YAHOO.widget.Tab({<br />  label: 'Tab Two Label',
  content: '&lt;p&gt;Loading, please wait...&lt;/p&gt;',<br />  dataSrc: 'tab2.html'<br />}), myTabs);</em>

myTabs.addTab( new YAHOO.widget.Tab({ <br />  label: 'Tab Three Label', <br />  content: '&lt;p&gt;Tab Three Content&lt;/p&gt;' <br />}));
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>The method “<code>delegate</code>” will do the job for you in an efficient way. The process is quite simple: </p>
<ul>
<li> The Tab object loads the content using the YUI Connection Manager </li>
<li> Before injecting the code using innerHTML, it passes the code to the dispatcher. </li>
<li> The dispatcher strips out the JavaScript and CSS code from the content. </li>
<li> The dispatcher injects the parsed content (without JavaScript/CSS tags) within the tab area. </li>
<li> The dispatcher executes each JavaScript chunk and injects each CSS tag in the order in which they appear. Remote JavaScript and remote CSS will be loaded using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/">YUI Get Utility</a> by default, which means that they are not subjected to the Cross Domain Policy. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bubbling-library.com/sandbox/dispatcher/plugin-dispatcher-dynamic-tabs.html">(Live demo.)</a></p>
<h3>Complex Example</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at a more complex example. In this case, the second tab loads some content, and the content defines its own functionality, creating/rendering a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">YUI DataTable</a> within it. Exactly the same code from the previous example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;<br /><em>YAHOO.plugin.Dispatcher.delegate (new YAHOO.widget.Tab({<br />  label: 'Tab Two Label',<br />  dataSrc: 'tab2.html'<br />}), myTabs, {
  /* Object literal with the area configuration */
});</em>

<em></em>
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>And the content of the file &quot;<code>tab2.html</code>&quot; should look like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; 
href=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.2/build/datatable/assets/skins/sam/datatable.css&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; 
src=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.2/build/datasource/datasource-beta-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; 
src=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.2/build/datatable/datatable-beta-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script<br />&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; 
src=&quot;http://bubbling-library.com/sandbox/dispatcher/data.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
<br />&lt;div id=&quot;basic&quot; class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;<br />var myColumnHeaders = [<br />  {key:&quot;id&quot;, sortable:true, resizeable:true},<br />  {key:&quot;quantity&quot;, type:&quot;number&quot;, sortable:true, resizeable:true},<br />  {key:&quot;amount&quot;, type:&quot;currency&quot;, sortable:true, resizeable:true},<br />  {key:&quot;title&quot;, type:&quot;html&quot;, sortable:true, resizeable:true}<br />];<br />var myColumnSet = new YAHOO.widget.ColumnSet(myColumnHeaders);<br />var myDataSource = new YAHOO.util.DataSource(YAHOO.example.Data.bookorders);<br />myDataSource.responseType = YAHOO.util.DataSource.TYPE_JSARRAY;<br />myDataSource.responseSchema = {<br />  fields: [&quot;id&quot;,&quot;quantity&quot;,&quot;amount&quot;,&quot;title&quot;]<br />};<br />var myDataTable = new YAHOO.widget.DataTable(&quot;basic&quot;, myColumnSet, myDataSource);<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>As you can see, the content of &quot;<code>tab2.html</code>&quot; is like another page, and the tab object works like an <code>iframe</code>. The differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a single document (less memory and bandwidth used by the browser).</li>
<li>The tab is sharing the execution scope with the current document (easy JavaScript integration).</li>
<li>There is more  flexibility for cosmetics because the container is just another DIV within the current document instead of being an iframe.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bubbling-library.com/sandbox/dispatcher/plugin-dispatcher-dynamic-tabs-with-datatable-inside.html">(Live demo.)</a></p>
<h3>Memory Leaks </h3>
<p>Now that we can create widgets and add listeners to certain elements within the tab content, we need to keep in eye on the memory management, especially in the tabs where we aren&#8217;t caching the dynamic content. In those tabs, the content will be loaded multiple times, replacing the old content and executing the scripts again. By default, the dispatcher releases all the listeners in the area before it displays  new content using <code>YAHOO.util.Event.purgeElement. </code>But sometimes this is not enough.</p>
<p>The destroyer is a hook method and is only available during the execution of the scripts from  dynamic content, which means that you can use this within the tab content: </p>
<pre>YAHOO.plugin.Dispatcher.destroyer.subscribe (function(el, config){   
  // el: HTML Element that grap the tab’s content   
  // config: Object literal with the area configuration */ 
}); </pre>
<p>And because the destroyer is a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/#customevent">YUI Custom Event</a>, you can add multiple listeners to it. The dispatcher plugin fires the Custom Event when you try to load a new content within the same tab.  </p>
<p>You can load fresh content within the tab by setting the cache property to false during the creation of the tab, and every time you click on the tab the YUI Connection Manager loads the content again.   </p>
<p>At this point, the dispatcher fires the destroyer Custom Event before switching the content of the DIV (tab’s wrapper). Then it will setup a new destroyer object for the new content, and you will be able to add new listeners for the new content. </p>
<p>This technique will allow you to create widgets and destroy them in a more memory-friendly way when the content changes. </p>

src=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.2/build/tabview/tabview-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<h4>Handling Errors (Debugging)</h4>
<p>There are two configuration options to handle errors:</p>
<pre>YAHOO.plugin.Dispatcher.delegate (new YAHOO.widget.Tab({<br />    label: 'Tab Two Label',<br />    dataSrc: 'tabs2.html'<br />}), myTabs, {
    onError: function (el) {<br />      // el: DOM Reference for the area<br />      // when the YUI connection manager call the failure method<br />      // 403, 404, etc<br />    },<br />    error: function (el, jsCode) {<br />      // el: DOM Reference for the area, jsCode: javascript code<br />      // this method get fired when a JS error occur during the execution<br />      // this is for debugging only...<br />    }<br />});
</pre>
<p><a href="http://bubbling-library.com/sandbox/dispatcher/error-handle.html">(Live demo.)</a></p>
<h4>Anonymous Functions</h4>
<p>The dispatcher plugin uses an anonymous function to execute inline scripts, introducing a problem with the global variables. Let’s see an example: </p>
<p><strong>Original Content:</strong> </p>
<pre>function myFunc () {   
  // your stuff here 
}
var myVar = 1; </pre>
<p><strong>The dispatcher transforms it into this:</strong></p>
<pre>(function() { 
  function myFunc () { 
    // your stuff here 
  } 
  var myVar = 1; 
})();</pre>
<p>So, “<code>myFunc</code>” and “<code>myVar</code>” are not global variables and are only accessible within the same script tag. </p>
<p>To tackle this issue, you should use <em>namespaces</em>: </p>
<pre>YAHOO.example.myFunc = function () { 
  // your stuff here 
};
YAHOO.example.myVar = 1;</pre>
<p>Or the nasty trick to force it to be global: </p>
<pre>window.myFunc = function () { 
  // your stuff here 
};
window.myVar = 1; </pre>
<h4><strong>Customizing the execution routine</strong></h4>
<p> There is a configuration argument to<br />
    customize the evaluation routine. The code should look like this:    </p>
<pre>YAHOO.plugin.Dispatcher.delegate (new YAHOO.widget.Tab({<br />    label: 'Tab Two Label',<br />    dataSrc: 'tabs2.html'<br />}), myTabs, {
    evalRoutine: myCustomEval<br />});</pre>
<p>In this case, <code>myCustomEval</code> should execute the script. </p>

<h3>Working Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bubbling-library.com/sandbox/dispatcher/plugin-dispatcher-dynamic-tabs.html">TabView and Dispatcher</a>
<p>        In this example the dispatcher manages the content inside the tabs, executing the scripts (remote and inline &quot;script&quot; tags) during the dataSrc request.</li>
<li><a href="http://bubbling-library.com/sandbox/dispatcher/plugin-dispatcher-dynamic-tabview-inside-tabview.html">        Nested TabViews</a><br />
        In this example, we use two different approach: one using the tab&#8217;s events to modify the loaded content and a second sing the dispatcher to leave the task to the content which is a more flexible approach.</li>
<li><a href="http://bubbling-library.com/sandbox/dispatcher/plugin-dispatcher-dynamic-tabs-with-datatable-inside.html">Tabview, DataTable and Dispatcher (<strong><em>check the last tab</em></strong>)</a>
<p>        In this example the dispatcher manages the content inside a tab to render a  YUI Datatable during the dataSrc request.</li>
<li><a href="http://bubbling-library.com/sandbox/dispatcher/ondestroy-utility.html">How to avoid memory leaks</a><br />
        In this example, you can see how the first tab &quot;Datatable Control&quot; define the rules to destroy the YUI Datatable.</li>
