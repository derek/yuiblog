[YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/) is just around the corner, and we can't wait. Here are some things we've noticed in the meantime:

-   **[YUI 3 on the New Yahoo! Mail Beta](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/yahoo-mail-beta/):** Mike Curtis writes about YUI 3 usage on the new Yahoo! Mail beta in a YDN blog post: "For JavaScript, we decided to use YUI3. Yahoo! Mail Beta is built using the YUI framework from the ground up. One of the great benefits of YUI is that it's modular, allowing us to pull in libraries as needed as opposed to downloading everything up front. Modernizing the markup and using YUI3 for JavaScript reduced total download size for the application by 35 percent, a huge performance win."

-   **[Sam Stephenson Releases Hork](http://github.com/sstephenson/hork):** Sam Stephenson from 37signals, author of the Prototype JavaScript library, has released a new project called Hork. According to Sam, "Hork is a little Rack middleware for transparently compressing JS & CSS assets with YUI Compressor."

-   **[Guild Wars 2 Site Launched with YUI 3.2.0 + Gallery](http://hom.guildwars2.com):** Pat Cavit ([@tivac](http://twitter.com/tivac)) [wrote in](/yuiblog/blog/2010/10/15/in-the-wild-for-october-15-2010/#comment-594681) to tell us about the new Guild Wars site. "We launched [http://hom.guildwars2.com](http://hom.guildwars2.com) which is a fully YUI 3-powered site. It takes advantage of Eric Ferraiuolo's overlay plugins, Ryan Grove's history module, a few custom-built (now in the gallery) anim plugins, a generic animation module), \[and\] all sorts of loader/base/event stuff. It also heavily uses the new transition module." ([Original source.](/yuiblog/blog/2010/10/15/in-the-wild-for-october-15-2010/#comment-594681)) [#](#yuiBlogWild-543)

-   **["Learning YUI Pt.3 – SimpleYUI and Exploring the API" (via @triptych)](http://andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2010/10/15/learning-yui-pt-3-simpleyui-and-exploring-the-api/):** Andrew Wooldridge continues his series of tutorials on YUI 3, this time with a look at SimpleYUI and `Y.log`. "SimpleYUI is like getting one of those cheese samplers in the mail. You dont have to go for a big commitment, but you can try out a lot of things without worrying about a lot of the safeguards you might later want to have. I have created [a landing page for SimpleYUI](http://whisperstorm.com/simpleyui/), but in summary its like getting to play with YUI without worrying about all that .use() stuff, or anonymous functions, etc. It’s a lot like how you might have experienced jQuery for the first time. You get a lot of powerful functionality up front, and you only need a single js + a few lines of code to get started. For some great examples, check out [this page from Eric Miraglia](http://ericmiraglia.com/yui/demos/quickyui.php). SimpleYUI gives you DOM, Events (and custom events!!!) transitions, and AJAX. It’s perfect for folks who just want to add some animations or fun effects for your site in no time flat."

The result: A simple Pong implementation. "In case you’re one of my clients, you might be wondering why I’ve been slacking off recently. Here’s why: I’ve been teaching myself ‘grown up’ JavaScript under instruction of Douglas Crockford (in [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-D-Crockford/dp/0596517742/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1287604036&sr=8-1) and [video](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) form, obviously). Crockford never mentions Test Driven Development, probably because he doesn’t do it. But I do, so I’ve been learning to do that in JavaScript too.So here it is, [HTML5 Canvas Pong](http://pong.andrewbruce.net/). Pong is [effectively a Hello, World! application](http://twitter.com/chrislowis/statuses/27854948346) for game developers. It’s not particularly fun, and my version is full of amusing bugs...."

You'll find the SimpleYUI checkbox under the library selection menu when you select YUI 3.2.0. (Thanks to Andrew Wooldridge for the tip.) [#](#yuiBlogWild-550)
