YUI, together with the [Yahoo! Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.com/), is excited to sponsor a complimentary [YUI 3 "Building Blocks, Modules, and Applications" Workshop](http://training.bocoup.com/PreJSConf-2011/#yui) on Sunday, May 1, 2011 in Portland, Oregon. This is a great way to kick-off your time at [JSConf](http://2011.jsconf.us/), but you do not need a JSConf ticket to attend the workshop. All are invited to this free event!

I will be joined by fellow Yahoo! [Gonzalo Cordero](http://twitter.com/#!/goonieiam) for a full-day of hands-on training where you will learn how to build stateful classes, plugins, and widgets using the YUI 3 infrastructure components, package them into reusable modules, and assemble them into a simple application. The morning class will focus on what the building blocks (such as Base and Widget) have to offer and when and how to use them. The afternoon class will get into more advanced class configurations, setting up the Loader to combine your hosted modules, and setting up application controllers to relate your various module classes and APIs via custom events.

Space is limited, so reserve your seat today at [http://training.bocoup.com/PreJSConf-2011/](http://training.bocoup.com/PreJSConf-2011/)
