NFL.com's Ryan Cannon ([@rcanine](http://twitter.com/rcanine)) joined us at YUIConf 2011 to share the story of why [NFL.com](http://www.nfl.com/) chose YUI over jQuery, how they migrated a large codebase from Prototype to YUI 3 on a tight schedule, and how they use YUI to create websites and mobile apps for one of the world's most popular sports leagues.
