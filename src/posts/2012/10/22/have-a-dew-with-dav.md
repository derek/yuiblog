![Grabbing a Dew in London](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3301/3521067391_9047e70e89_m.jpg) A few months back, I hinted about the idea that I would do a public Hangout just to chat and socialize with the YUI community. Since then, I have received several requests to live up to my offer. This **Friday (October 26th) at 1:00pm CST** I will open a public Google Hangout that anyone is free to join. I'll be there to answer your questions, demo some of the things I'm working on, and to just shoot the breeze. It's not formal and won't be recorded until we do a few more of these Hangouts. I also can't promise that I won't be smoking, cursing or chugging some Dew while the Hangout is open, so headphones are advised! Make sure you [add me](http://profiles.google.com/davglass) to one of your circles so you can see the notice. I'll see you then!
