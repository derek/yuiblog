Firefox has been in the news quite a bit in the past few days, so it is fitting that we release the video of the YUIConf 2013 presentation that [Bill Walker](https://twitter.com/wfwalker) gave entitled "[Firefox Marketplace: Breaking the Stranglehold of App Stores](http://youtu.be/pE-uVuq1SNM)". We hope you enjoy it! Be sure to check out [last Friday's talk](/yuiblog/blog/2014/02/21/yuiconf-2013-akshay-patel-and-seth-bertalotto-on-grunt-your-world/) as well as all of the released talks on our [YouTube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKP9DUCzZorde6sLWHJ3GNd-6VrGrbqm).
