YUIBlog's "[In the Wild](/yuiblog/blog/category/in-the-wild)" series is our chance to highlight interesting YUI-related content from around the Web. In this installment I've pointed to integrations with PHP's symfony framework, .Net, Perl, and Ruby, as well as some other choice links. Hope you enjoy seeing them as much as I enjoy finding them. As always, please suggest links that we should hightlight in the comments, on YUI's [mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript), or by tagging them with [yui.blog on del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/tag/yui.blog).

-   Matt Berseth, a .Net developer, has been posting prolifically lately, including: [YUI DataTable Styled ListView](http://www.mattberseth.com/blog/2007/11/yui_datatable_styled_listview.html), [YUI Styled 'Tip of the Day' Dialog using the PopupControl, DynamicPopulate and DragPanel Extender Controls](http://mattberseth.com/blog/2007/11/yui_styled_tip_of_the_day_dial.html), [YUI Style Yes/No Confirm Dialog with the ModalPopupExtender](http://mattberseth.com/blog/2007/10/yui_style_yesno_confirm_dialog.html), [YUI Style AJAX Progress Indicator](http://mattberseth.com/blog/2007/10/yui_style_ajax_progress_indica.html), [A YUI DataTable Styled GridView](http://mattberseth.com/blog/2007/10/a_yui_datatable_styled_gridvie.html), and [Creating a YUI TabView Style Theme for the AjaxControlToolkit's TabContainer Control](http://mattberseth.com/blog/2007/09/creating_a_yui_tabview_style_t.html). It's great to see people getting so much use out of YUI, and taking the time to share their experiences.
-   James Gardner says "The YUI toolkit comes with a very flexible autocomplete control but a common requirement is for an autocomplete control that submits the ID associated with a text value rather than the text value itself, much like a select field submits the option value, not the contents the user selects from a drop down list" and offers up [YUI Autocomplete AJAX Select Drowdown with ID](http://jimmyg.org/2007/10/19/yui-autocomplete-ajax-select-drowdown-with-id/) as a possible approach.
    
-   Yurii Rashkovskii was "unhappy with YUI Loader because it has no idea about Rails asset\_host" so he wrote [YUI Loader and asset\_host](http://rashkovskii.com/articles/2007/10/21/yui-loader-and-asset_host) to fill the gap.
    
-   "There is a lot of choice on the CPAN for open source Perl libraries and sometimes it's difficult to get an idea of how modules compare to each other." To address this, John Wang used YUI's [DataTable](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable) to create [CPAN Compare](http://www.dev411.com/perl/cpancompare) which pulls "the CPAN Ratings from a number of modules and summarize them for you." For more on the technology behind CPAN Compare, read [John Wong's account on his blog](http://www.dev411.com/blog/2007/11/09/comparing-cpan-modules-with-yui-datatable).
    
-   The open-source PHP web framework [symfony project](http://www.symfony-project.org/) now has [sfYuiPlugin](http://trac.symfony-project.com/wiki/sfYUIPlugin) which "contains the Yahoo! UI javascript libraries".
    
-   Jakob Heuser (a frontend engineer at Gaia, see [Implementation Focus: Gaia](/yuiblog/blog/2007/09/25/gaia/)) recently released a [Just In Time (JIT) Loader script](http://www.felocity.org/blog/article/just_in_time_loader_for_javascript/).
    
-   Nick Bouton posted a tutorial based on his experience with [rounded corners with YUI TabView](http://www.nickbouton.com/archives/2007/11/07/tutorial-rounded-corners-with-yui-tabview).
    

Until next time, happy coding!
