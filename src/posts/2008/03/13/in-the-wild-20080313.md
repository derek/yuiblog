Just a brief [in the wild](/yuiblog/blog/category/in-the-wild) update this morning as we work on an upcoming bug fix release to follow up on [YUI 2.5.0.](/yuiblog/blog/2008/02/20/yui-250-released/) Some fun and interesting links to share:

-   [**More support for YUI on .Net**](http://opensource.openbracketllc.com/yuinet/Default.aspx): We wrote in our [last "In the Wild"](/yuiblog/blog/2008/03/05/in-the-wild-20080305/) about [Luke Foust looking for help with his popular YUI.Net project](http://www.codeplex.com/YuiDotNet). Colin Mathews dropped a [comment](/yuiblog/blog/2008/03/05/in-the-wild-20080305/#comment-321869) about his similar [YUI-on-.Net effort, which includes support for some of YUI's most popular components like DataTable, Calendar, and the Rich Text Editor.](http://opensource.openbracketllc.com/yuinet/Default.aspx) Colin, thanks for the note, and great work on the project.
-   [**LinkedIn redesigned with YUI**](/yuiblog/blog/2008/03/05/in-the-wild-20080305/#comment-317237): Emanuel [commented](/yuiblog/blog/2008/03/05/in-the-wild-20080305/#comment-317237) on our previous post that we'd neglected to mention [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/)'s YUI-driven redesign. We'll spend some time with Steve Ganz and others on the team over there as soon as we can and share more details about what they're doing with YUI and how it's working for them.

-   **[Nine Rich Text Editors reviewed](http://blog.webdistortion.com/2008/03/09/9-of-the-best-rich-text-editors-reviewed/):** WebDistortion of Northern Ireland took a look at nine different JavaScript-based rich text editors, and [here's what they had to say](http://blog.webdistortion.com/2008/03/09/9-of-the-best-rich-text-editors-reviewed/) about Dav Glass's [YUI RTE](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/):
    
    > The [Yahoo UI library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) is a brilliant resource for developers, and their [UI editor component](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/) is no exception. Although it is still in beta, the result so far looks extremely impressive, and I for one would be comfortable using it in a commercial application. It uses fully object orientated javascript libraries with classes than can be extended if you know what you are doing. It comes with partial image support (via URLS not uploads), but an interesting sample on the site [shows how to integrate a flickr image search](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/editor/flickr_editor.html), and [an integrated calendar](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/editor/cal_editor.html) which would be useful in the blogging world. Please look into this Wordpress developers..it rocks socks.

-   **[Satyam's YUI Loader explorer](http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/dependencies.html)**: [YUI Community Award-](/yuiblog/blog/2008/02/27/community-awards/)winner [Satyam](http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/) wanted to see us do a better job using [YUI Loader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/) to show YUI's dependency tree, so he coded up a quick [YUI Loader component/filelist generator](http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/dependencies.html) that allows you to configure your YUI dependencies based on the components you're using. We'll take this idea and move it onto the YUI site itself very soon; thanks Satyam!
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/imagepallet.png)](http://patorjk.com/software/colorpalletgenerator/)**[Patrick Gillespie adds the YUI Slider to his Color Pallet Generator](http://patorjk.com/blog/2008/02/27/yahoo-ui-and-image-color-pallet-generator-updates/)**: This is more an excuse just to mention Patrick's [cool pallet generator](http://patorjk.com/software/colorpalletgenerator/), into which you can submit an image URL and be presented with color pallettes based on the colors in your image. Patrick has added a hue adjustment control implemented with the [YUI Slider](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/), which makes a nice tool even more useful.
-   [**Dave Dash's Triangle Toggler**](http://spindrop.us/2008/02/25/building-a-triangle-toggler-in-yui/): It wouldn't be an "In the Wild" post these days if we didn't have a cool tutorial from Dave Dash at [spindrop](http://spindrop.us/). In this edition, he weighs in with a [triangle toggler control](http://spindrop.us/2008/02/25/building-a-triangle-toggler-in-yui/) to show expand/collapse states. And it wouldn't be a Dave Dash demo without full code and explanations.
-   **[More from Dave — Star rating widget with YUI and Django](http://spindrop.us/2008/03/04/star-rating-using-yui-and-django/):** Dave starts with the Yahoo! Design Pattern Library's [star-rating pattern](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=ratinganobject) and [uses YUI to build out a slick star-rating widget](http://spindrop.us/2008/03/04/star-rating-using-yui-and-django/).
-   **[Markus Tripp's Intro to YUI Tutorial](http://mext.at/?p=20):** Markus Tripp posted a nice intro to YUI for those new to the library, "[Getting Started: JavaScript and the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library](http://mext.at/?p=20)". Thanks for the great writeup, Markus!
-   **[Andrew Wooldridge's DOM Splicer Demo](http://www.andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2008/03/yui-demo-dom-splicer.html)**: "Imagine if you will," Andrew writes, "that DIV and P elements on a page were like little organisms floating in the browser. Their DNA would be represented by the CSS properties that they possess. Such things as borders and background colors, etc. Now imagine if we took some YUI libraries and gathered up all these elements and "spliced" their CSS DNA. Then we create a new DIV which we then assign this new spliced CSS and drop it into the page." [Check out his article](http://www.andrewwooldridge.com/blog/2008/03/yui-demo-dom-splicer.html) and [demo](http://andrewwooldridge.com/work/domsplicer/domsplicer.html) for his YUI-based DOM-splicer.
