Thank you to everyone who submitted a talk proposal for [**YUIConf**](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/) this year! We're excited to bring in some fresh ideas to make this the best year ever, but as always the quality of the tech talks will be the highest priority.

Highlights include:

-   Gesture events, mobile apps, testing, and performance
-   Case studies from Yahoo Search, Yahoo Mail, and Yahoo Sports
-   Back by popular demand, a sequel to [last year's talk](/yuiblog/blog/2012/12/10/yuiconf-2012-talk-writing-for-developers-some-rational-techniques-by-evan-goer/) by Evan Goer ([@evangoer](https://twitter.com/evangoer))
-   Keynotes by Eric Ferraiuolo ([@ericf](https://twitter.com/ericf)), Ariya Hidayat ([@ariyahidayat](https://twitter.com/ariyahidayat)), and Dav Glass ([@davglass](https://twitter.com/davglass))
-   And much, much more!

Take advantage of this opportunity to meet the YUI team as well as fellow community members. It's an excellent time to get a glimpse of the future as well as look back on the progress we've made over the past year in features, performance, and stability.

For complete newbies, the [YUI Intro Workshop](http://yuiconf2013-workshops.eventbrite.com/) on **November 5** is a great way to ramp up fast on YUI basics, just in time to hit the conference at full speed. And seats are still available for the [Building Blocks Workshop](http://yuiconf2013-workshops.eventbrite.com/) for anyone looking to take their YUI skills to the next level.

[Early Bird pricing](http://yuiconf2013.eventbrite.com/) for YUIConf 2013 ends **October 25**!
