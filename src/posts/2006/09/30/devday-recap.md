![Matt Sweeney addresses developers at the Yahoo Developer Day/Open Hack Day in Sunnyvale; Sept. 29, 2006](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/devday/sweeney_hackday06.gif)

Yahoo's first [Developer Day and Open Hack Day](http://hackday.org) is well underway, with the [Developer Day talks and workshops](/yuiblog/blog/2006/09/22/yahoo-devday-schedule/) done and hacking now in seriously caffeinated progress. There was big news yesterday: [Yahoo! Mail](http://news.com.com/Yahoo+to+give+away+e-mail+code/2100-1032_3-6121552.html) — with 247 million users — announced an API, the Yahoo! Developer Network announced [a new user-authentication API](http://developer.yahoo.com/auth/), and some other APIs were enhanced (my favorite: [Flickr is now offering JSON](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/response.json.html)).

It was a big day for the YUI developer team. **Nate Koechley** kicked things off in the morning with a standing-room-only crowd exploring the YUI CSS toolkit, while **Todd Kloots**, **Adam Moore**, **Steven Peterson**, **Allen Rabinovich**, and **Thomas Sha** followed with additional workshops. **Matt Sweeney** gave one of the featured talks of the afternoon, "Web 2.0: Getting It Right the Second Time" ([slides available here](/yuiblog/devday06/web2/web2.ppt)). More than 300 developers packed the conference building at Yahoo!'s Sunnyvale headquarters for the sessions, which led up to last night's concert by Beck on the lawn ([the puppets were amazing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/256158354/), and there's [a funky little video](http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=2a6da7a27cd603f00682c2e8f1ed0ea4.910378&vback=Profile&vdone=http%3A//video.yahoo.com/video/profile?ei=UTF-8&yid=ycorpblog) that Yahoo!'s and Beck's marketing people put together).

Many gallons of Red Bull have been consumed throughout the night, and hacks (including many using YUI) are being assembled this morning; we can't wait to see what everyone's cooked up when the show starts at 3 p.m.
