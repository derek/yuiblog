[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf-bear-20091104-173939.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/standardpixel/4056467662/)[Stephen Woods](http://stephenwoods.net) ([@ysaw](http://twitter.com/ysaw)) introduced [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) attendees last week to the inner workings of YUI's documentation tool, [YUI Doc](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/), written by YUI architect Adam Moore. If you're interested in how YUI Doc can help you generate thorough, always-up-to-date API docs for your projects, this is a session you'll want to watch. Stephen is a platform engineer at Yahoo! working on systems that are integral to the new Yahoo! home page. Thanks to Stephen for the fantastic talk and for letting us share it with you here.

Note: About 18 minutes into Stephen's session, someone [wearing a bear costume](http://www.flickr.com/photos/standardpixel/4056467662/) walked into the presentation room — off camera, but clear to everyone in the room (see picture at right). [Stephen rightly notes](http://twitter.com/ysaw/statuses/5434452626) that his reaction was more justified than it will seem from just watching the video.
