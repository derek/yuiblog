**Problem Summary**

A user wants to quickly leave their opinion on an object, with minimal interruption to any other task flow they are involved in.

One excellent [design principle](http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2006/01/nine-tips-for-designing-rich-internet.html) to follow is to allow the user to leave a light footprint. This means encouraging light-weight actions for engagement by [providing invitations](http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2005/11/musings-on-mouse-hover.html). Instead of the user having to go through several steps to rate a movie or a news article, invite them to simply click to rate. The [Rating an Object](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_dragdropmodules.php) pattern is an excellent example of this principle.
