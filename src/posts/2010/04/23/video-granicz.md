[![Adam Granicz, CEO of Intellifactory, speaking at Yahoo! on April 21, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/granicz-20100422-092113.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=granicz-websharper)

Adam Granicz stopped by Yahoo! earlier this week to talk about [the F# programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_\(programming_language\) "F Sharp (programming language) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") and its use in web application development.

Granicz's company, [Intellifactory](http://www.intellifactory.com/ "Products - WebSharper Platform(TM)"), produces the WebSharper platform. WebSharper fills the role in the F# community that [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ "Google Web Toolkit - Google Code") and similar tools fill in the Java community, promising a strongly typed, fast, tightly integrated development experience with deployment to rich web applications. As [Fybit's Riatrax4JS](/yuiblog/blog/2010/02/02/fybit-riatrax4js/ "Fybit Riatrax4Js: Program YUI in Java » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)") and [yui4java](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/13/yui4java-a-new-java-to-javascript-translator-using-yui-2/ "yui4java: A New Java-to-JavaScript Translator Using YUI 2 » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)") do for Java developers, WebSharper brings the power of [YUI 2](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/2/ "YUI 2 — Yahoo! User Interface Library") to F# developers, making a wide range of YUI widgets available.
