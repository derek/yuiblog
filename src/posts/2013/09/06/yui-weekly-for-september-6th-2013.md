_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   Hot of the release of last week's YUI 3.12.0 GA, this week saw the release of **YUI 3.13.0 Beta 1**. As noted in the [announcement](/yuiblog/blog/2013/09/04/yui-3-13-0-beta-1-released/), the primary focus of this release is to provide a build for developers to test a new [content editable feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_Editable) in [Editor](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/editor/). Also included in this release are updates to [DataTable](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/datatable/), [History](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/history/), [ScrollInfo](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/modules/node-scroll-info.html), and [Widget](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/widget/). To see all the specific changes, check out the [YUI 3.13.0 Beta 1 Change History Rollup](https://gist.github.com/triptych/6430650). Happy testing!
    
-   At this week’s [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable), discussion topics included [YUI 3.13.0 Beta 1](/yuiblog/blog/2013/09/04/yui-3-13-0-beta-1-released/), an inline Editor demo, discussion about upcoming Widget and Button updates, and YUIConf. You can find a video of that Hangout [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fks_KWzwU30).
    
-   Just a friendly reminder, a few weeks ago the project [announced](/yuiblog/blog/2013/08/21/announcing-the-new-yui-community-forums/) plans to migrate from the YUI Forums to [yui-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yui-support). Please subscribe to the new group if you haven't already, and begin posting any support questions there instead of the forum. Thanks!
