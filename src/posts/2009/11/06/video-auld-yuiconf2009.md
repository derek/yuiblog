[Chad Auld](http://opensourcepenguin.net/) ([@chadauld](http://twitter.com/chadauld)) is a Yahoo! engineer best known for his work on [MiaCMS](http://miacms.org/) and [Sideline](http://sideline.yahoo.com). Chad recently [drove the open-source release](/yuiblog/blog/2009/09/14/yui-php-loader-beta-release/) of [YUI's PHP Loader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/phploader/) (taking over from original developer Adam Moore \[[@admo](http://twitter.com/admo)\]), and he came to [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) last week to talk about the project and provide an introduction to its core features. PHP Loader provides a generic, flexible loading mechanism for modular JavaScript/CSS projects, and while it ships with [YUI 2](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/2/) and [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/) metadata it can be used for any frontend project written in PHP. Chad's talk gave the audience a unique opportunity to hear about this utility directly from its chief coder.
