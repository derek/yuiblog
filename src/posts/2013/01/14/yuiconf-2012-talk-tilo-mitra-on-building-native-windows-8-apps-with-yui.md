[Tilo Mitra](http://lanyrd.com/profile/tilomitra/) has the distinction of being part of not just one but two different talks at [YUIConf 2012](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf) (The [other presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpyBAQt7hUs&feature=share&list=PLjKP9DUCzZooMmiSJ_nmsLIReOZp0Uomz) he shared with [Jeff Conniff](http://lanyrd.com/profile/jeffconniff/).) His drive and energy are apparent in this next talk in our series, which you can catch up via [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByU2zn9DmAA&list=PLjKP9DUCzZooMmiSJ_nmsLIReOZp0Uomz) or [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/).

In this YUIConf 2012 talk, the YUI team member Tilo Mitra describes how a developer can leverage YUI for building Windows 8 applications. Tilo's talk provides a detailed look at how native applications on Windows 8 can be built using a combination of YUI and the native APIs. He provides an introduction to Windows 8, WinJS, and explains how YUI can help make applications faster with clean, modular code.
