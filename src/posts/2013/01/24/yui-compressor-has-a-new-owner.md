[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wl4rkiLbVtg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHqk/0MG6-7flLns/s250-c-k/photo.jpg "Joey Smith")](https://plus.google.com/u/0/104335391146630932889/posts) Recently we announced that we were deprecating our use of [YUI Compressor](/yuiblog/blog/2012/10/16/state-of-yui-compressor/). Many people still rely on Compressor for their day to day work and are still using it in their build systems. In our ongoing effort to involve more community members we are pleased to announce our latest External Contributor, [Joey Smith](https://plus.google.com/u/0/104335391146630932889/posts). Joey has volunteered to take over the YUI Compressor project and continue its development into the foreseeable future. He has been given full commit access to the [YUI Compressor repository](https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor) on GitHub as well as control over the [new mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/yuicompressor). This new mailing list will be replacing the [forum on YUILibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=94) as the official location for support and technical discussions. As of today, Joey has earned Committer status and as we continue to define our new [Contributor Model](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model) he will work his way toward full Reviewer status on this project.
