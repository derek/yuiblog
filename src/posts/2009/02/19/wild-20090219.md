It's been a big week in the YUI world, with [YUI 2.7.0](/yuiblog/blog/2009/02/18/yui-270/) being released and [our third birthday](/yuiblog/blog/2009/02/18/yui-3rd-birthday/) coming up. But, as usual, most of the news is coming from the YUI community, with new implementations, articles, and adaptations emerging every day. Here's some of the YUI news we've noticed in the past few weeks:

-   **[YUI Sightings — Flurry, Real-time Mobile Anlaytics](http://www.flurry.com/):** According to [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2009/01/26/flurry-launches-iphone-and-android-developer-analytics-tools/): "San Francisco-based [Flurry](http://www.flurry.com) has launched a new mobile application analytics tool that works across a variety of mobile platforms, including the iPhone and Google’s Android. Today, the company is announcing that more than 300 developers have used its free service since the beta launched in October... The program also works with BlackBerry and Java ME platforms (though not Palm). Flurry lets developers see exactly how consumers use their applications, and provides information on which features of the application are used and for how long."  Flurry uses a third-party charting library and a wide assortment of YUI components in its Google Analytics-style dashboard.

-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/jChat-20090129-105904.jpg)](http://opensourcepenguin.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=129)**[Chad Auld, "jChat - YUI, Jaxer, & ActiveRecord"](http://opensourcepenguin.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=129):** Writes Chad: "For those familiar with [MiaCMS](http://miacms.org) you'll already know I'm a huge fan of the [Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/).  I recently finished up the JavaScript work for version 4.8 of MiaCMS.  With some free-time on my hands I figured what better way to fill it than with a new project?  So I set out to learn some new technology and see how I might mash it up with some existing skills like YUI.  The new technologies I decided to experiment with were Aptana's [Jaxer](http://aptana.com/jaxer) and their new [ActiveRecord.js](http://activerecordjs.org) framework. Jaxer ships with a number of basic samples, but I've seen quite a few people online in search of more complex examples and specifically ones that make use of the new ActiveRecord.js library.  The extended example I developed is called jChat.  jChat is fully functional chatroom application that demonstrates integration of the following web related technologies; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, YUI, Jaxer, and Activerecord.js."
-   **[Sarah Gray of DevChix on Using YUI DataTable with Rails](http://www.devchix.com/2009/02/07/using-yui-datatable-with-rails/):** [Writes Sarah](http://www.devchix.com/2009/02/07/using-yui-datatable-with-rails/): "I am currently working on an Rails app that integrates the [YUI DataTable](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/), and in going through the tutorials I noticed they are all assume a PHP back-end. I also saw a number of people asking how to get this to work with a Rails controller, so I thought I’d write up my experience in the hopes that it helps someone else."  She provides detailed code samples and exposition [in her post](http://www.devchix.com/2009/02/07/using-yui-datatable-with-rails/).

-   **[YUI Sightings — Favicon Editor from Ed Eliot, Cyril Doussin, and Stuart Colville](http://favicon-generator.org/):** Old friends Ed, Cyril and Stuart have formed Project Fondue, and one of their new creations is a web-based favicon editor. The frontend is built with YUI, including [YUI Loader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/) and a fantastic implementation of [YUI Color Picker](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/colorpicker).

-   **[YUI Sighting — Diddit, a Social Lifelist for the Web](http://www.diddit.com/):** [diddit](http://www.diddit.com/) is a new experience-sharing site that makes your best life experiences sharable in a checklist format.  [Check out TechCrunch's coverage of their launch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/diddit-a-social-to-do-list-for-your-life/).  TechCrunch writes that diddit  "is looking to help you check off all the things you’ve done with your life, and discover new things that you’d like to do. The site allows users to browse through thousands of activities in categories ranging from the bars you’ve visited to 'Bizarre Retro Candies' you’ve eaten at one time or another. To coincide with the launch, Ludic Labs, the company behind Diddt, has also announced that it has closed a $5 million funding round led by Accel Partners with KPG Ventures also participating."  They're launching with a frontend laced with more than a dozen YUI components.

-   **[Simon Tiffert on "Javascript Unit Tests with the YUI TestManager"](http://www.agimatec.de/blog/2009/01/javascript-unit-tests-with-the-yui-testmanager/):** Over on the Agimatec blog, Simon Tiffert writes about test-driven development and unit tests in JavaScript: "The easiest \[tests to use\] are unit tests. We have tried several JS unit test frameworks. Including JSUnit, Scriptaculous Unit Test Runner and [YUI Test](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/). With a lot of YUI components like the [YUI Loader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/) and many YUI widgets we refactored our unit tests to use YUI Test. We like the Yahoo User Interface because of its documentation and also...its code quality."
-   **[YUI Sightings — StanfordAlumni.org](http://www.stanfordalumni.org/):** Good to see [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) being used on [the alumni website up at The Farm](http://www.stanfordalumni.org), where, many years ago, [Yahoo was founded in a trailer by two grad students](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/28/BUGJUBGR5D1.DTL&type=printable).  YUI Core ([Yahoo](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yahoo/), [DOM](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/), [Event](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/)), [TabView](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/) and [Containers](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/) are all in use.

-   **[YUI Sighting — "The Marketplace" OpenSocial/MySpace Storefront App](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=436964776):** Navaneeth Krishnan, founder of NetCarnation, emailed to tell us about [The Marketplace](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=436964776).  The Marketplace is a storefront built for OpenSocial platforms, and it currently runs in MySpace and Friendster.  Nava writes: "The Marketplace is completely written using YUI and we have used almost all YUI components in the product including [Animation](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/), [Button](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/button/), [Dom](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/), [Dialogs](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/dialog/), [Paginator](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/paginator/) and [TabView](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/). Since OpenSocial is a Javascript-based API, our complete rendering is based on YUI."  You can check out some [example stores on MySpace here](http://profile.myspace.com/Modules/Applications/Pages/Canvas.aspx?appId=122995).

-   **[Matt Snider on Augmenting YUI Cookie](http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/library-yui-augmenting-cookie/):** Matt Snider of Mint is back with more built-on-YUI innovation in his exploration of Nicholas C. Zakas's [YUI Cookie Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/cookie/). Cookie is robust, Matt writes, but "there are a few methods that were missing: ‘getNumberOfCookies’, ‘getCookieSize’, and ‘isCookiesEnabled’. The ‘getNumberOfCookies’ function returns the number of cookies currently set; simply splitting around ‘;’ seems to work in the browsers I tested. Let me know if there is a better way or browser issues I missed. The ‘getCookieSize’ method does a pretty good estimation of the cookie size, by assuming all alpha-numeric characters are not escaped and thereby stored as 1 byte and all non-alpha-numeric characters are escaped and thereby stored as 3 bytes. Although, the later is not always true, it is a fairly accurate assumption; I am open to a better regex that considers the other characters which are not escaped. Lastly, the ‘isCookiesEnabled’ enabled function determines if Cookies are enabled, first by looking at the ‘navigator’ object, then by checking if there is a cookie set, and lastly by adding a test cookie."  [Check out Matt's blog for the full scoop and code samples](http://mattsnider.com/languages/javascript/library-yui-augmenting-cookie/).

-   **[AutoComplete Inputs with PHP, Pear and YUI](http://devzone.zend.com/article/4229-Building-AutoComplete-Inputs-with-PHP-PEAR-Dojo-and-YUI):** Vikram Vaswani of DevZone [writes about using YUI with PHP and PEAR](http://devzone.zend.com/article/4229-Building-AutoComplete-Inputs-with-PHP-PEAR-Dojo-and-YUI), noting that [YUI's AutoComplete](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/) provides all the frontend magic you need to create search-suggest and other innovative interactions. "Add a little bit of server-side glue, in the form of a PHP script that talks to a database to generate valid suggestions, and enabling this functionality in a Web application now becomes a matter of hours, rather than days. In this article, I'll show you how to do this using three different libraries: PEAR HTML\_QuickForm, YUI, and Dojo. [Come on in, and find out more](http://devzone.zend.com/article/4229-Building-AutoComplete-Inputs-with-PHP-PEAR-Dojo-and-YUI)!"
-   **[Bret Levy's Dialog-with-Confirmation Demo](http://yuihelp.levycodev.com/demos/dialog/confirm_on_submit.php):** Bret Levy of Levycode is back with a new demo "showing how to setup a dialog submission with a confirm step...  We have a sample form which accepts some fields and has save, delete and cancel buttons. The form itself 'blocks' submission by normal means -- that is, there is no submit button and the <form> tag contains code to block any browser's 'standard' or 'default' submissions (such as when the enter key is pressed)."  [Check out his post for full code and the working demo](http://yuihelp.levycodev.com/demos/dialog/confirm_on_submit.php).

-   **[Norman Kosmal on Django and AJAX Using YUI](http://normankosmal.com/wordpress/?p=37):** Blogs [Norman](http://normankosmal.com/wordpress/?p=37): "I was wondering how requests via AJAX can be implemented into Django framework. So I wrote a small application and hooked it into an existing Django project for testing purposes. The application has two models, Employee and Project, and two methods. The first method fetches data from the project and employee tables and renders that data onto a template. The second method takes care of the AJAX request and returns a JSON string. There is javaScript code embedded on the template itself, which is responsible for the AJAX requests and manipulating DOM on a successful response."  [Check out his post for full sample code](http://normankosmal.com/wordpress/?p=37).
