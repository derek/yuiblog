### A DataTable update and gallery showcase

The 3.4.0 release cycle is coming to a close and will be packed with all sorts of great features, but speaking plainly, DataTable hasn't gotten as much development focus as it should have. There have been some bug fixes, though, and a fair amount of planning for changes that are targeted in 3.5.0, and a great start to community involvement with its development.

We know that DataTable is an incredibly important widget for a lot of customers, so we understand the cost of delaying focused development. This Open Hours will be an update on what work is getting done for 3.4.0, what's planned for 3.5.0, and an introduction to the great work that's begun to spring up in the Gallery to add features and fix bugs for DataTable (and its family of supporting classes).

We'll be online **an hour earlier** this week for the benefit of Eamon Brosnan (aka, mosen from #yui), who's provided a number of the Gallery patches we'll be looking over. Otherwise, we'll have other #yui denizens and Gallery contributors showing their wares. If you have a DataTable solution or work in progress you'd like to share, please let me know so I can block out the schedule to fit everything (ls\_n in #yui or [twitter](http://twitter.com/ls_n)).

### Time & Details

We'll be online from **9am to 10am PDT Thursday**. The connection details are the same as usual.

2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953#
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

_Note_: Because it's an open conference line, we ask that callers **mute their lines** unless they are participating in active discussion.
