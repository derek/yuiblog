With [YUI 2.8.0](/yuiblog/blog/2009/09/14/yui-2-8-0/), [YUI 3.0.0](/yuiblog/blog/2009/09/29/yui-3-0-0/), and [PHP Loader 1.0.0 beta 1](/yuiblog/blog/2009/09/14/yui-php-loader-beta-release/) out the door, the team here is focused on our final big objective for the year: [YUICONF2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/). Brendan Eich and Douglas Crockford will be keynoting next week at our first public, YUI-focused conference. In addition to the YUI engineers presenting sessions, we're looking forward to hearing from community members like Matt Snider and Eric Ferraiuolo. While the conference is sold out, [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) will be there capturing as much as it can — so stay tuned here for video coverage as it becomes available.

Here are a few of the other YUI-related news items we've tracked in the past few weeks. If you have an item we missed, or something you'd like to see covered in the next update, please leave a note in the comments; for all the latest YUI news as it happens, follow [yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) on Twitter.
