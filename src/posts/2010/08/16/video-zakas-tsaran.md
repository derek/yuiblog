[![Nicholas Zakas and Victor Tsaran's Talk at the BayJax event at Yahoo! in June, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/zakas-tsaran-blog-june-10.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=zakas-tsaran)

In June, Yahoo! hosted a [BayJax](www.meetup.com/BayJax/) meetup dedicated to web accessibility. Nicholas Zakas, Yahoo! homepage developer, and Victor Tsaran, Yahoo! senior accessibility program manager, gave a talk on the process of making Yahoo!'s homepage highly accessible.

We apologize for the uneven audio levels: there were technical issues with the microphones that we unfortunately were only able to adjust towards the second half of the talk.
