-   This week marks the conclusion of the month-long 3.7.0 development cycle. With code frozen, any further changes to 3.7.0 will be minimal, and what you see in Master [at the moment](https://github.com/yui/yui3/tree/649173504ff547cf5281be2f563cdd629dfaccec) should be very close to the final GA release. Next steps are a 2nd preview release (PR) before general availability (GA) of 3.7.0. Stay tuned!
    
-   The video from last week's Open Hours has been posted. [Check it out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4ozoej5y08) to learn more about some of the new tools Dav has been working on, including [Shifter](https://github.com/davglass/shifter) and [Yogi](https://github.com/yui/yogi), as well as an overview of [YUI Target Environments](/yuiblog/blog/2012/08/21/yui-target-environments/) and [yui-lint](https://github.com/yui/yui-lint).
    
-   Thanks to Luke Smith (ls\_n) for the [Y.Deferred pull request](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/241) which could add `Y.Deferred` and `Y.Promise`, as well as `Y.when`. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of "Promises" in JavaScript, here's a blog post from Microsoft about the concept, [Promises and Futures in JavaScript](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rbuckton/archive/2010/01/29/promises-and-futures-in-javascript.aspx) (also, [the follow-up](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rbuckton/archive/2011/08/15/promise-js-2-0-promise-framework-for-javascript.aspx)).
    
-   `Y.Color` also got a [pull request](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/236) this week. "The Color Utility will give you the ability to convert colors to and from RGB, HSL, and Hex. Color also has several methods that receive one color and return other colors that are harmonious, or adjusted, in a variety of useful ways."
    
-   [gallery-devtools](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/devtools) is a neat concept, "a set of modules to be loaded in development environments to increase the noise level of YUI around certain common mistakes that should be detectable but aren't exception causing."
    
-   [YUI Masonry](http://yui-masonry.appspot.com/) is a dynamic layout widget for YUI that was inspired by Pinterest and Masonry.
    
-   Here's a tutorial for a [Simple JavaScript App using Node, cocos2D, YUI and Heroku](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2012/07/25/A-simple-JavaScript-app-using-Node-cocos2D-YUI-and-Heroku.aspx).
    
-   FYI: [JSFiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net) now supports YUI 3.6.0.
    
-   New/Updated modules in the [Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) this week: [md-model](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/md-model), [formmgr](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/formmgr), [datatable-selection](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datatable-selection), [google-maps-loader](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/google-maps-loader), [bottle](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/bottle), [datatable-paginator](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datatable-paginator), [datatable-formatters](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datatable-formatters), and [contextmenu-view](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/contextmenu-view).
