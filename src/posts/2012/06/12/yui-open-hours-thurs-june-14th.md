### Yahoo Axis, built on Mojito and YUI

A couple of weeks ago, Yahoo! released [Axis](http://axis.yahoo.com/), a mobile browser and desktop browser plugin combo to improve web browsing across all your devices. It's been getting great reviews, it's free, and it just so happens that it's built with Mojito and YUI!

Representing the Axis Frontend team, Lead developer [Caridy Patiño](http://twitter.com/caridy) and coworker [Eugene Kashida](http://twitter.com/ekashida) will join us to talk about how it was built, but there's too much to cover in an hour, so we want your help deciding what to focus on. Here are some options:

1.  we can focus on the YUI components used, which were extended, and which were custom built for Axis,
2.  we can talk about the product in general and the architecture decisions that were made, such as hybrid vs native vs web (this probably won't allow much time to dig into the code),
3.  or we can focus on how Mojito was used, configured, and get more into the guts of that technology.

Let us know in the comments or tweet us [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) which you prefer or if you have other ideas!
