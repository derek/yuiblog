Thanks to everyone for coming out to [YUIConf 2012](http://lanyrd.com/2012/yuiconf/)! I think I speak for everyone on the team by saying we all had an incredibly fun time. It was great to see old faces again, and also to meet new community members as well. Since there was too much happening at this year's event to all recap in one YUI Weekly post, over the coming weeks you'll see more details on this blog covering topics such as the [YUI Contributor Model](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model), more details on the [new Gallery submission process](http://yui.github.com/yogi/gallery/index.html), announcements for new tools, and lots more. We'll also be releasing videos of the talks to the [YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/yuilibrary) beginning next week. So stay tuned! Thanks again for helping make YUIConf a great event, and safe travels to all those heading home.
