[![Douglas Crockford delivers the fifth lecture in his his Crockford on JavaScript lecture series at Yahoo on March 31, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/crockonjs-5-20100405-083224.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockonjs-5)

The final installment of the [Crockford on JavaScript](/yuiblog/crockford/) lecture series begins like this:

> I believe that children are our future. And also, I believe, robots. Children and robots...

He turns quickly to issues of security in the browser:

> The worst of all of its security problems is the so called cross site scripting attack, or XSS. It's not called CSS because that would be confused with the Crappy Style Sheets system that's in the browser. It really shouldn't be called cross site scripting either, because there are modes of this attack which have nothing to do with operating across sites. You can have one of these attacks happening within a site. What it really is is a confusion of interest attack. One thing that's unfortunate is that the security experts who identified and named it got it wrong, and have not corrected it since then, and expect all the web practitioners to be adopting their broken jargon. We're going to talk a lot about these classes of problems, and how we're going to fix them.
