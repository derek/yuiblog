If you have yet to be convinced that [YUIConf 2012](http://www.yuilibrary.com/yuiconf) was the best conference yet, then perhaps this next video will help change your mind. We continue our series of video releases with one entitled "**Mojito for YUI Developers**" by [Caridy Patiño](http://lanyrd.com/profile/caridy/). You can find [previous posts](/yuiblog/blog/2012/12/05/yuiconf-2012-talk-yui-open-source-and-community-from-eric-ferrauiolo/) in this series here, as well as keep up with all of the videos via [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/yuilibrary).

In this presentation from YUIConf 2012, Mojito engineer Caridy Patiño talks about the Mojito project and its usefulness for YUI developers. In particular, Caridy discusses Mojito's rich offering of boilerplate and building capabilities for YUI projects, with a variety of options to build traditional YUI web apps, mobile apps to deploy on devices, and Node.JS applications as well. Caridy also describes how Mojito leverages YUI library and YUI tool chains to build at scale.
