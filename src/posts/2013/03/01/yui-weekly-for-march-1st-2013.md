_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, leave a comment below._

-   As [announced a few days ago](/yuiblog/2013/02/27/yui-3-9-0-delayed/), the 3.9.0 GA release originally scheduled for this week has been delayed at least a week. In the meantime, you can begin using [YUI 3.9.0pr3](/yuiblog/2013/02/19/yui-3-9-0pr3/) to satisfy your v3.9 cravings.
    
-   We have a [new team member](/yuiblog/2013/02/27/welcome-eugene-kashida-to-the-yui-team/), so here's a big YUI Weekly welcome to Eugene Kashida ([@ekashida](http://twitter.com/ekashida))!
    
-   The instance of Wordpress that powers yuiblog.com experienced a change last week which has broken the commenting capabilities. We don't have an ETA on a fix, but hopefully soon. In the meantime, you can always find us on of IRC in #yui (Freenode) and on Twitter at [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary). **Update**: Fixed!
    
-   Yesterday's [Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Bdh1XUA0g) is now up on the [YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/yuilibrary). Discussion consisted of YUI Benchmark demos, a conversation about touch+mouse capable devices, additional transparency for roadmap & feature development, and concluded with the decision to take the next steps on deprecation of node-menunav and node-focusmanager.
    
-   [YUI Skin Builder](http://yui.github.com/skinbuilder/) now has a new feature. You can select _which_ YUI Widgets you want to skin. A new "Items" tab has the UI checkboxes. The "Skin Preview" shows only selected Widgets, and best of all, the "Code" tab textarea contains _only_ the CSS for the Widgets you select.
    
-   [World Card Games](http://worldofcardgames.com/) is a website containing a variety of playable card games, and is built using YUI. Fun for all ages!
    
-   New and updated [Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) modules include [bottle](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/bottle), [csslist](https://github.com/tilomitra/csslist/), [csstable](https://github.com/tilomitra/csstables), [itsacalendarmarkeddates](https://github.com/ItsAsbreuk/yui3-gallery/tree/master/src/gallery-itsacalendarmarkeddates), [itsacalendarmodellist](https://github.com/ItsAsbreuk/yui3-gallery/tree/master/src/gallery-itsacalendarmodellist), [itsadtcolumnresize](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/itsadtcolumnresize), and [sm-treeview](https://github.com/smugmug/yui-gallery/tree/master/src/sm-treeview).
