In this talk from YUIConf 2011, YUI engineer Satyen Desai discusses what he learned about mobile performance -- and how those learnings will feed back into YUI -- when he spent a few months working with the [Yahoo! Livestand](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/livestand-from-yahoo!/id469314404?ls=1&mt=8) team on their gorgeous (and blazing fast!) new iPad app.
