### Implementation focus: bigbigtweet.appspot.com

#yui IRC channel regular, Mitchell Amihod (aka [meeech](http://twitter.com/meeech)) finished a single-sprint project recently using YUI, python, and [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/). The result was [Big Big Tweet](http://bigbigtweet.appspot.com/).[![bigbigtweet.com home page](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bigbigtweet.jpg)](http://bigbigtweet.appspot.com/)

His goal was to start and finish within a couple days, and he met his goal.

The site is using YUI 3 grids, IO, delegation, the valueChange synthetic event, and more. It's a good example of rapid prototyping with YUI 3, so join us as we dive in with Mitchell.
