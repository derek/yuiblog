If you're heading to [Web 2.0 Expo](http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/content/home) this week, stop by the big Yahoo booth and say hello. Dav Glass will be at the booth tomorrow (Wednesday) and Jenny Han Donnelly will be joined by Adam Moore on Thursday along with our friends and colleauges from the [Yahoo Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.com/). We'll have YUI Cheat Sheet packets to give away and lots of other good YDN schwag; come by early and often! Dav, Adam and Jenny will obviously be there to answer any questions you might have about YUI, too, so bring those by if you want some one-on-one time with the team.
