**Happy New Year!** After feasting on holiday dinners and chugging unhealthy amounts of egg nog, I'm back to start off another segment of YUI Weekly. It's been a relaxed week here as we get back into the groove. That doesn't mean that we haven't been pushing out code, though! There's still a lot to share, so let's get started.

# Release News

Not too much on the YUI front this week, but there was a [YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) build today. The following modules have been updated: [`gallery-itsamessagecontroller`](http://gallerydocs.itsasbreuk.nl/gallery-itsamessagecontroller/), [`gallery-itsaselectlist`](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/itsaselectlist), and [`gallery-itsaformmodel`](http://gallerydocs.itsasbreuk.nl/gallery-itsaformmodel/). They are all written by [Marco Asbreuk](http://twitter.com/itsasbreuk), who will be joining us at next week's Open Roundtable.

# Open Roundtable

In this week's [YUI Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable), Clarence and Andrew welcomed our latest "YUI In the Wild" guest, [Jonathan Tsai](https://twitter.com/jontsai) from [Talentral](http://talentral.com). Unlike usual episodes, Jon was there in person instead of on Google Hangout. Jon talked about how him and his team built Talentral using YUI and other web technologies. I highly recommend checking it out!

Next week, we have another episode of YUI in the Wild with our guest and popular YUI contributor, [Marco Asbreuk](http://twitter.com/itsasbreuk).

# YUIConf Videos

We know everyone has been waiting for those YUIConf videos, and they are here at last! Hallejulah! We're releasing the videos [in the same order that they were presented in](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/2013/schedule/). We have two videos out so far: [YUI and the Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qN3mHH5snc) by [Eric](http://twitter.com/ericf), and [YUI and the new Server-side Front End](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ1zYrAZPB8) by [Clarence](https://twitter.com/clarler). There will be more coming next week.

## Stay Tuned

This is going to be a great year for YUI! We have a lot planned (watch [Eric's talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qN3mHH5snc) for more details), and I'm really excited to share and be a part of the cool stuff that we are building with the community. Here's to 2014!
