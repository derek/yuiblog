### `Y.Calendar` is coming to 3.4.0

![](/yuiblog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/blog-calendar.jpeg)

Calendar is one of our more popular widgets in the YUI 2 family, and it's making its debut on the YUI 3 architecture in 3.4.0. [Allen Rabinovich](http://twitter.com/allenr) is the component owner and author and will be on the call reintroducing us to this old favorite, showing some new approaches to problems faced by 2.x Calendar. I'm particularly jazzed about the support for internationalization, but the new rendering rules are also pretty fascinating.

Come on in, and bring your date-picker, event-calendar, import-from-iCal-and-make-pancakes questions and feature requests with you as we flesh out the now and future `Y.Calendar`. (No, it won't import iCal, but if somebody wants to create a gallery module to tame that beast, there's sure to be a YUIConf ticket in it for you ;) )

We're back to our usual time this week, so we'll see you in Connect at 10am PDT.

### Time & Details

We'll be online from **10am to 11am PDT Thursday**. The connection details are the same as usual.

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (Skype works great for non-US participants\*)
2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953#
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

_Note_: Because it's an open conference line, we ask that callers **mute their lines** unless they are participating in active discussion.

\* - If Skype is not an option, email me or catch me (ls\_n) in the #yui IRC channel on freenode for a local number.
