[![Douglas Crockford delivers the first lecture in his his Crockford on JavaScript lecture series at Yahoo on Janurary 25, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/crockonjs1-20100126-134304.png)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockonjs-1)

In the [first part](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockonjs-1) of Douglas Crockford's [five-part series on the JavaScript programming language](/yuiblog/crockford/), he explores the historical context from which JavaScript emerged. But he begins with a little bit of his own history, relating his efforts as a child to build a homemade computer:

> I found some pieces of particle board and a saw and I sketched out what it was going to look like, and started sawing. I sawed, and sawed, and sawed. The particle board was really, really hard, and the saw was really, really dull. I sawed for what must have been at least two minutes, and then I gave up. OK, I'm not going to do that. So I probably went into the house and watched television after that. At that time, even at that tender age, it was already obvious that I was going to be a software guy.

For the better part of two hours, Douglas takes you on a historical journey in which you learn about:

-   the origin of the eighty-character limit
-   the history of punch-cards and their impact on modern programming
-   the origin of the term "spaghetti code"
-   why accessibility has gone downhill since the days of the Teletype
-   why we're still living with both a carriage return character and a line feed character, and where those concepts originated
-   the genealogy of command-line text editors
-   what languages like ALGOL, Simula, and Self have to do with JavaScript
-   why "the guys who could write for the \[Atari\] VCS were heroes"
-   why innovation in software is slower than innovation in hardware

[A few tickets remain](/yuiblog/crockford/) for the next four installments of the series, which resumes Friday night with ["**Chapter 2: And Then There Was JavaScript**."](http://crockford-survey.eventbrite.com/) We hope to see you here.
