## YUI Open Roundtable

This week's [Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XhtP5arLHE) featured Drew Folta discussing Intl support in Modown. The talk was a great introduction to using Intl for localizing your Modown projects.

## In the JavaScript World

There were some interesting developments this week in the world of JavaScript:

-   The Chromium team posted an article [explaining background compilation](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/02/compiling-in-background-for-smoother.html?utm_source=javascriptweekly&utm_medium=email) in Chrome.
-   [Matt Baker](http://flippinawesome.org/authors/matt-baker/) wrote an article on how you'd go about [replacing callbacks with ES6 generators](http://flippinawesome.org/2014/02/10/replacing-callbacks-with-es6-generators/?utm_source=javascriptweekly&utm_medium=email).
-   This is an older article but one that I found valuable this week: How to [automatically test CSS](http://css-tricks.com/automatic-css-testing/) by Simon Madine over at CSS Tricks.

That's all for this week! Happy Valentine's Day to everyone!
