Yahoo UK technical evangelist Christian Heilmann made his way to Leeds last week to give a talk on YUI for the GeekUp folks. The Northcast web podcast team has video of that talk online if you'd like to take a look. They did a fantastic job with their pre/post-roll — not too many tech videos show you the beer being dispensed prior to the talk. Don't think that we at the [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) aren't taking notice!
