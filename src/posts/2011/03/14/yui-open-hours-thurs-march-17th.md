### Ajax

This week, I want to hijack the hour to talk about [Y.io](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/io/) (and friends) and do a little brainstorming on what you all think would make YUI 3's ajax interfaces the best they can be. I have some thoughts I'd like to share, and we can scan through some [existing bugs and feature requests](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/query?status%5B%5D=new&status%5B%5D=assigned&status%5B%5D=accepted&component=IO&milestone=&priority=&location=&version=&severity=&summary=&description=&keyword=&owner=&type=&resolution=&reporter=&create_until_date=mm%2Fdd%2Fyy&create_since_date=mm%2Fdd%2Fyy&browser=&until_date=mm%2Fdd%2Fyy&since_date=mm%2Fdd%2Fyy&cc=&changed_days=&created_days=&col%5B%5D=id&col%5B%5D=type&col%5B%5D=priority&col%5B%5D=owner&col%5B%5D=milestone&col%5B%5D=status&col%5B%5D=summary&order=priority&dir=desc&order1=&dir1=desc&order2=&dir2=desc&max=100&report_name=&report_private=on&update=Update&bmod_value_location=Example#report-result).

Really, though, I want to hear from you what sorts of patterns you tend to implement in the real world, and what sort of API sugar we could add to make your life easier. Because we'll do it. I swear.

Here's a sampler from the gallery today:

-   [REST Resource](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/resource)
-   [IO Multi-response](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/io-multiresponse)
-   [AlloyUI IO](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/aui-io) and [IO Request](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/aui-io-request)
-   [Comet Stream](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/comet-stream)
-   [JSON-RPC](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/jsonrpc)
-   [IO Poller](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/io-poller)

Maybe some of the answers are in there? What do you want baked in, and what do you want it to look like?

### Time & Details
