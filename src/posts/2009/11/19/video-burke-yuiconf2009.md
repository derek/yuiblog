[![YUI engineer Reid Burke speaks at YUICONF 2009, held at the Yahoo! HQ in Sunnyvale; October 28, 2009.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/burke-yuiconf2009-yap-20091110-103304.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=burke-yuiconf2009-yap)

The [Yahoo! Application Platform (YAP)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yap/) allows you to write programs that run on the Yahoo! network — on the Yahoo! home page, My Yahoo!, and beyond. Reid Burke ([@reid](http://twitter.com/reid)) of the YAP team came to [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) to talk not only about YAP but about how you can use [YUI 2](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/2/) within your YAP applications ([we wrote about this on YUIBlog not long ago](/yuiblog/blog/2009/10/28/yui-2-8-0-on-yap/)).
