At the February 6, 2012 [BayJax](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/) event at Yahoo!, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) Frontend Engineer and [SoundManager](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/) developer Scott Schiller ([@schill](http://twitter.com/schill)) uncovered HTML5 audio's dark and dirty secrets, and explained why he thinks both HTML5 audio and Flash audio have their place. Then he wowed the audience with a couple of spectacular live demos that you won't want to miss.
