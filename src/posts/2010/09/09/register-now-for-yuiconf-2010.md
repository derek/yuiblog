The YUI team is excited to open [early-bird registration for YUIConf 2010](http://yuiconf2010.eventbrite.com), to be held November 8-10 on Yahoo!'s Sunnyvale campus. Registration costs $50 this year for 3 days of technical and insightful sessions spanning all things YUI, YQL, and NodeJS. Be sure to register before October 8 to receive the early-bird rate of $35. More details will be made available as the schedule gets finalized, but you can count on learning the latest new features, best practices, and tips and tricks.

If you can't join us this time around, sessions will be video-taped and available on YUI Theater for all to enjoy.

Hope to see you there!
