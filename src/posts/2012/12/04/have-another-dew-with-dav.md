[![Dew!](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4045/4528630121_bb6c94a2b8_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/arapehl/4528630121/ "Dew! by Ara Pehlivanian, on Flickr") After all the goodness that [I announced at YUIConf](/yuiblog/blog/2012/11/19/you-are-the-yui-team-yuiconf-2012-recap-keynote-video/ "YUIConf Keynote") last month I figured it was time to open up a Hangout and talk about it. This **Friday (December 7th) at 1:00pm CST** I will open a public Google Hangout that anyone is free to join. I’ll be there to answer your questions, demo some of the things I’m working on, and to just shoot the breeze. It’s not formal and probably won’t be recorded until we do a few more of these. I also can’t promise that I won’t be smoking, cursing or chugging some Dew while the Hangout is open, so headphones are advised! Make sure you [add me](http://profiles.google.com/davglass) to one of your circles so you can see the notice. I’ll see you then!
