						<div class="entry">
							<p>For my first sprint of 3.6.0 development I&#8217;m writing up (and showing by example) how to develop an app using YUI on the client <em>and</em> server, which works on both the desktop and mobile devices. Code sharing and reuse FTW! To start this process, I wanted to first build something using the development approaches that we want to promote. I&#8217;ve done that and I want to report in on my first experience running YUI on Node.js (spoiler: it was awesome!)</p>
<p><a href="http://photosnear.me/">Photos Near Me</a>, an app that shows you interesting photos near your current location, is a project I started almost a year ago to dogfood the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/">YUI App Framework</a> while <a href="http://twitter.com/yaypie">Ryan Grove</a> and I were writing it. I&#8217;ve been keeping the app up to date with the latest changes and additions to the App Framework, including the use of <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/#app-component"><code>Y.App</code></a>, the newest component in the App Framework. Photos Near Me has always been a client-side only app up until now!</p>
<p>My plan was to power the Photos Near Me server using Node.js, Express.js, and YUI, and I set two goals: share the app&#8217;s model objects and share its <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/handlebars/">Handlebars</a> templates between the client and server. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/davglass">Dav Glass</a> who has put in a ton of effort to make <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/yui/nodejs.html">YUI run on Node.js</a> in an intuitive, seamless way, I was able to easily accomplish these goals after several hours of refactoring the app. I was pleasantly surprised that my first try instantiating one of the model objects server-side and calling its <code>load()</code> method, which fetches data from YQL, <em>just frickin&#8217; worked!</em></p>
<p>Photos Near Me now renders the initial state for a request on the server then hands off control to the client-side <code>Y.App</code> instance. From there, in modern browsers which can use HTML5 History, all routing, data fetching, and page rendering will be done client-side; while older browsers will perform full page loads handled by the server. The time from request to seeing photos has been drastically reduced, it was especially noticeable on my iPhone when refreshing the page.</p>
<p>Being able to use the <em>exact same code</em> for the models and templates between the client and server makes following the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/#best-practices">best practices</a> of progressive enhancement much easier to implement.</p>
<p>Check out Photos Near Me:<br />

<p>And its source:<br />

<p>Watch for my comprehensive tutorial on building apps with YUI which will use Photos Near Me as an example to describe and show in detail how to use YUI on the server and client to build apps which run in desktop and mobile browsers while following the best practices of progressive enhancement.</p>

						<div class="entry">
							<p>When I sat down to build the YUI 3 version of <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/layout">Page Layout</a>, I knew it would be a big job.  Even though the YUI 2 version was on its third incarnation, the code was still a mess.  The original design, dramatically simplified from the performance disaster of the second incarnation, called for only row-based layouts, but then somebody needed a column-based layout, and they needed it fast, so instead of refactoring the code cleanly, I duplicated it and rewrote only the layout engine.  In addition, I knew that the only way to get people to migrate from the YUI 2 version to the YUI 3 version would be to maintain exactly the same API in the YUI 3 version, so nobody would have to rewrite their code.  To make matters worse, the YUI 2 version was a global object that automatically instantiated itself when the script loaded, so application code could configure it and subscribe to events before domready.  The worst implication of this was that the initial object assumed a row-based layout, and then, on domready, if a column-based layout was detected, the object silently replaced itself, copying the settings from the old object!  (The row and column versions shared the same event objects, so the subscribers were not affected.)</p>
<p>With all this to consider, the first thing I did was to ignore it all because I wanted to get the YUI 3 version right.  I was satisfied with the basic API, but the two copies and the silent switching on domready had to go.  Inspired by the YUI 3 Plugin architecture, I decided that the ideal solution would be to have a single class which detected the layout type and used the corresponding layout engine.  The YUI Loader would even allow me to load the layout engine on demand!  It took a couple of weeks to shred the two YUI 2 classes and merge them into a single class with plugins, but the result was clean and (as long as you don&#8217;t look too closely at the code in the layout engine plugins) simple.</p>
<p>Now came the hard part:  how to make this a drop-in replacement for the YUI 2 version.  The applications that use it still have lots of YUI 2 code, and this cannot reference <code>Y</code>, so <code>YAHOO.APEX.PageLayout</code> had to be defined, it had to be created when the script loaded, and it had to expose all the required functions and event signatures.  To muddle things further, YUI 3 event signatures are fundamentally different from YUI 2 event signatures.</p>
<p>There was also another serious complication:  YUI 3 doesn&#8217;t really like global objects.  Everything is normally confined to the <code>Y</code> sandbox created by <code>YUI().use()</code>.</p>
<p>The first step was to break the sandbox by storing the instance of <code>Y.PageLayout</code> in <code>YUI.SATG.prototype.layout_mgr</code>.  (By instantiating <code>YUI.SATG</code>, each sandbox starts with the same initial values and can then safely modify <code>Y.SATG</code> without affecting other sandboxes.  Of course, overwriting <code>Y.SATG.layout_mgr</code> would be a bad idea, but there is other stuff in this object, too.)</p>
<p>Breaking the sandbox is not something to be done lightly, however.  The most dramatic problem is that <code>instanceof</code> does not work on objects passed between sandboxes.  This is disasterous for <code>Y.PageLayout.elementResized()</code>, since the argument, an instance of <code>Y.Node</code>, is likely to come from a sandbox other than the one where <code>Y.PageLayout</code> was instantiated.  Thankfully, YUI 3.5.0 switched from <code>instanceof Y.Node</code> to testing for the <code>_node</code> member!</p>
<p>The next step was to define <code>YAHOO.APEX.PageLayout</code> (but only if <code>YAHOO</code> already existed, of course).  This object turned out to be very thin, since it only had to act as a relay.  It stores references to functions in <code>Y.PageLayout</code>, including a couple of renames, and instances of <code>YAHOO.util.CustomEvent</code>.</p>
<p>The final step was to subscribe to the events from <code>Y.PageLayout</code>, repackage the data, and fire the corresponding events in <code>YAHOO.APEX.PageLayout</code>.  As an example:</p>
<pre>
page_layout.on('beforeResizeModule', function(e)
{
	YAHOO.APEX.PageLayout.onBeforeResizeModule.fire(e.bd, e.height, e.width);
});
</pre>
<p>I hope this overview of the challenges I faced will inspire you, or at least make the task seem less daunting, when you migrate to YUI 3.</p>

						<div class="entry">
							<p>When working with tabular data, it is nice to be able to see as many columns as possible.  If the table is the only widget on the page, then you can let the table expand and the viewport will scroll.  However, this will not work if you need to display multiple tables along with other modules in a more complicated arrangement.  Since  traditional, fixed width layout is not acceptable, this led to the creation of <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/layout">Page Layout</a> which supports fluid layout of multiple modules on a page.</p>
<p><a href="http://jafl.github.com/yui3-gallery/layout/cols.html" title="YUI 3 Page Layout Screenshot"><img src="http://jafl.github.com/yui3-gallery/layout/example.png"></a></p>
<p>(<a href="http://jafl.github.com/yui3-gallery/layout/cols.html" title="YUI 3 Page Layout Example">Click the screenshot to play with this example</a>.)</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Page Layout provides fluid layout for modules arranged either in rows or columns.  Each row or column contains one or more modules.  Each module contains an optional header, a body, and an optional footer.  (A previous incarnation of Page Layout supported arbitrary layouts via nesting, but this turned out to be way too slow.)</p>
<p>You can set the size of each row or column and the size of each module within a horizontal list or vertical stack.  Since the layout is fluid, all sizes are specified as percentages of the available width or height.  You can also set the minimum supported width and height of your layout (in em&rsquo;s), to ensure that none of the modules on your page shrink too small.</p>
<p>Modules can be collapsible.  A single module in a row (or a module in a vertical stack) collapses vertically, folding up so only the module header is visible.  A single module in a column (or a module in a horizontal line) collapses horizontally into a thin bar which can be clicked to re-expand the module.</p>
<p>Individual modules can be a fixed size, managed by CSS.  However, this is an edge case, and will not be discussed in this article.  Please refer to the <a href="http://jafl.github.com/yui3-gallery/layout/rows-fixed.html">examples</a> for details.</p>
<p>Page Layout also supports a page header and page footer which span the width of the page.  These are assumed to be fixed height containers.</p>
<p>Page Layout has three modes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Fit to viewport</dt>
<dd>
<p style="margin:0">This is the default.  The layout is adjusted to fit the viewport.  Each module has a vertical scrollbar if the content is taller than the allocated space.  The viewport scrollbars only appear if the viewport is smaller than the configured minimum size.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fit to content</dt>
<dd>
<p style="margin:0">The layout&rsquo;s width is adjusted to fit the viewport, but each module&rsquo;s height expands to show all the content.  The viewport&rsquo;s vertical scrollbar appears if the layout is taller than the viewport.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Single module</dt>
<dd>
<p style="margin:0">This mode automatically takes effect if there is only one module on the page. <q>Fit to content</q> is used if the content is not as tall as the viewport.  Otherwise, <q>fit to viewport</q> is used.  This is especially useful for a module with controls in the footer, because the controls will stay close to the content instead of being stuck at the bottom of the viewport.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The layout is specified in the markup by attaching classes to the appropriate divs, so you can continue to build the contents of each module the way you normally do.</p>
<p>For a row-based layout, the structure is:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="layout-hd"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="layout-bd" style="visibility:hidden;"&gt;
	&lt;div class="layout-module-row"&gt;
		&lt;div class="layout-module"&gt;
			&lt;div class="layout-m-hd"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;div class="layout-m-bd"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;div class="layout-m-ft"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="layout-ft" style="visibility:hidden;"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>The page header and footer are optional.</p>
<p>The visibility styles are removed once the layout is ready to be displayed.  This avoids displaying the raw contents while the page loads.</p>
<p>To transpose to a column-based layout, simply change <code>layout-module-row</code> to <code>layout-module-col</code>.  Note that you cannot mix rows and columns.</p>
<p>You can stack as many rows or columns as you want, and you can stack as many modules as want inside each row or column.  Of course, if you put too much on one page, the modules will be so small that nothing will be visible!  (For efficiency, the layout algorithms do not degrade gracefully.  Caveat emptor.)</p>
<p>To set the height of a row or a module inside a column add <code>height:N%</code> to the class, where N is a positive number.  To set the width of a column or a module inside a row add <code>width:N%</code> to the class.</p>
<p>To change the mode to <q>fit to content,</q> add <code>FIT_TO_CONTENT</code> to the class of the main body div (<code>layout-bd</code>).  If you want to avoid the <q>single module</q> behavior, add <code>FORCE_FIT</code> to the main body div&rsquo;s class.</p>
<h4>Collapsible Modules</h4>
<p>Modules that collapse vertically simply hide the body and footer.  The elements for collapsing and expanding both go inside the module header.  Here is an example using buttons:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="layout-m-hd"&gt;
	...
	&lt;button class="layout-vert-collapse-nub"&gt;&uarr;&lt;/button&gt;
	&lt;button class="layout-vert-expand-nub"&gt;&darr;&lt;/button&gt;
	...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Modules that collapse horizontally are replaced by a thin strip that serves as the expand button.  Here is an example of collapsing left:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="layout-module"&gt;
	&lt;div class="layout-left-expand-nub"&gt;
		&lt;div&gt;&rarr;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class="layout-m-hd"&gt;
		...
		&lt;button class="layout-left-collapse-nub"&gt;&larr;&lt;/button&gt;
		...
	&lt;/div&gt;
	...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>To collapse to the right, replace <q>left</q> with <q>right</q> in the above CSS classes.  (Page Layout does not actually make any distinction between collapsing left or right, but the classes are useful for styling.)</p>
<p>Modules can be collapsed or expanded programmatically by using the API:  <code>collapseModule</code>, <code>expandModule</code>, <code>toggleModule</code>, and <code>moduleIsCollapsed</code>.  All four functions require that you pass the div containing the module, i.e., the one that has the class <code>layout-module</code>.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Once you instantiate Page Layout, it immediately begins managing the modules on the page, so you don&rsquo;t have to do much.  Page Layout automatically reflows the layout when the window is resized or the text size is zoomed.  However, you must notify Page Layout when an element on the page changes size.  Simply call <code>elementResized</code> and pass the element that changed.  You must also notify Page Layout if you add or remove modules, by calling <code>rescanBody</code>.</p>
<p>When displaying a widget that manages its own scrollbars, e.g., <code>Y.DataTable</code>, you need to notify the widget when the module is resized.</code>  Page Layout fires two events:  <code>beforeResizeModule</code> and <code>afterResizeModule</code>.  The <a href="https://github.com/jafl/yui3-gallery/blob/master/src/gallery-layout-datatable/js/layout-datatable.js">plugin for DataTable</a> shows how to handle these events.  Before the module is resized, reset the height to auto.  Afterwards, set the height to fit the module.</p>

With his usual sardonic wit, he starts at the beginning (almost literally &#8212; with the invention of language itself) and makes a strong case for designing secure software based on fundamental principles rather than specific techniques, tricks, or hacks.
