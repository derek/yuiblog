-   [YUIConf 2013](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/) is quickly approaching! [Registration](/yuiblog/2013/09/17/yuiconf-2013-registration-now-open/) is now open, and if the last 4 years are any indication, there will be a full house so register soon! We're also happy to announce that there will be [two workshops](https://yuiconf2013-workshops.eventbrite.com/) the day before the conference available for anyone interesting in enhancing their knowledge of the library. One class is an entry level course while the other provides more advanced information.

-   Core team member Clarence Leung ([@clarle](https://gist.github.com/clarle)) [posted a gist](https://gist.github.com/clarle/6644126) that proposes the introduction of `AttributeComputable` and `BaseComputable`, which centers on the idea of idea of computable properties. These are properties where one `Attribute` may be dependent on the value of one or more other `Attributes`.
