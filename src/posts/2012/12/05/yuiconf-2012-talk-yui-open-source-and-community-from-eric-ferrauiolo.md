One of the main themes of [YUIConf 2012](http://www.yuilibrary.com/yuiconf) was **community**. In the blog post "[You Are the YUI Team: YUIConf 2012 Recap & Keynote Video](/yuiblog/2012/11/19/you-are-the-yui-team-yuiconf-2012-recap-keynote-video/)" we went into some detail about this next video, which became one of the highlights of the whole conference. As always, check out our [earlier videos](/yuiblog/2012/12/03/yuiconf-2012-talk-anthony-pipkin-on-building-modules-for-the-new-gallery/), [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/), and our [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/yuilibrary) to catch up on our previous video releases.

In this talk and town hall discussion from YUIConf 2012, senior YUI Engineer [Eric Ferraiuolo](http://lanyrd.com/profile/ericf/) presents his thoughts on how YUI can continue to progress with and for its community. His initial presentation sets the context for a town hall conversation where developers who use YUI share their feedback and insights.
