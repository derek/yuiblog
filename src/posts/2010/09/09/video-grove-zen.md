[![Ryan Grove speaking about performance and YUI 3 at Yahoo! on September 1, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/ryangrove-20100902-094041.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=grove-zen)

YUI engineer Ryan Grove gave a talk recently at Yahoo! in which he laid out a vision for how to approach performance in YUI 3-based applications. The approach is philosophical, strategic, and practical — and it's the best summary I've seen so far of how to think about these issues in the YUI 3 world. If you work with YUI on a regular basis, this is a video you don't want to miss.

-   [**Douglas Crockford:** Crockford on JavaScript -- Scene 6: Loopage](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-loopage) — Software development is hampered by a specific set of design mistakes that were made in the first programming languages and repeated in everything that has been done since. And, somewhat miraculously, JavaScript is going to make it right, radically transforming the way we write applications. Again. In the Loop of History, it has all happened before, but it has never happened like this. This is why you should care about the emergence of server-side JavaScript and the excitement around projects like Node.js — not because they're at the sharp end of a trend, but because they're paving the road toward the next big revolution in software.
