### Checking in with Dav Glass

It's been a while since we checked in with [Dav Glass](http://twitter.com/davglass). You know he's always good for some interesting innovation, and it's about time to get a report on the new shiny (or green-on-black) stuff he's been working on for the last few months.

Since Dav took over Loader, he's been pretty busy doing the usual thing of adding test coverage and improving performance, but there are a few new things on top of that that are [worth noting](https://github.com/davglass/loader-alone). Otherwise, he's made some [updates to the YUI core and npm packages](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/yui/nodejs.html) to make YUI development even easier in Node.js. And, knowing him, he probably has a few more rabbits to pull out of a few more beanies.

### Recording

The recording is [available in the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQIMYJLVeHY&list=UUTHcgWOTU6gPje1g_U29tfQ).
