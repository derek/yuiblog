_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, leave a comment below._

-   Development is winding down for the next release of YUI, currently [scheduled](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#wiki-next-release) for **for February 26th**. While today marks code freeze for new feature development, the pull request window is still open until **February 19th** for any bug fixes. With the new feature window closing, we've seen a few notable pull requests being merged into the `3.x` branch (aka: `3.9.0`), including [Y.Tree](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/429), [Normalize.css](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/447), [A+ Promises](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/445), and [more](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed). Give 'em a spin and file a [ticket](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/newticket/) (or [issue](https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues)) if you notice any irregularities.
    
-   Ryan Grove ([@yaypie](https://twitter.com/yaypie)) [announced](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/y1UnHRyKBvk) on yui-contrib that he has published a prototype of his [node-focusmanager](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/node-focusmanager/) replacement. Check out the [Demo](http://jsbin.com/odizof/2), [Source](https://github.com/smugmug/yui-gallery/tree/master/src/sm-focusmanager), and [Docs](http://smugmug.github.com/yui-gallery/api/classes/Plugin.FocusManager.html). Woo!
    
-   Added to the [YUI Theater](http://www.youtube.com/user/yuilibrary) this week was [YUI Open RoundTable 2/14/2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3CpNlbl7rU), where we discussed performance benchmarking. This included a preview of `ybench`, a [Benchmark.js](http://benchmarkjs.com/)\-based tool to ease the pain of perf testing with YUI.

-   Reads of the week:
    
    -   Opera announced their adoption of WebKit ([300 million users strong, Opera moves to WebKit](http://my.opera.com/haavard/blog/2013/02/13/webkit)), which prompted insightful responses from Mozillians Brenden Eich ([Why Mozilla Matters](https://brendaneich.com/2013/02/why-mozilla-matters/)) and Christian Heilmann ([I will miss the "Douglas Crockford of browsers"](http://christianheilmann.com/2013/02/13/i-will-miss-the-douglas-crockford-of-browsers/)). Farewell Presto.
