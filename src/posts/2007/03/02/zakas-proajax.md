[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/proajax.gif)](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/proajax.pdf)Yahoo!'s [Nicholas Zakas](http://www.nczonline.net/) is the author of two excellent books from WROX Press. His fist book, [Professional JavaScript for Web Developers](http://shopping.yahoo.com/search?p=professional+javascript+for+web+developers&did=&x=0&y=0), is a volume we rely on at Yahoo! for internal training classes on JavaScript. Nicholas's second book with WROX is [Professional Ajax](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Ajax-2nd-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/0470109491/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-3139599-2797740?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1172869428&sr=8-1), the 2nd Edition of which has just been released.

In this new edition, Nicholas spends part of Chapter 4 exploring the [YUI Connection Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/). He dives into its usage and steps through the implementation of asynchronous XMLHttp requests including the passing of arguments, form handling, callbacks, scope, timeouts and more. This chapter also includes a look at Connection Manager's file upload feature. With his cogent style and clear examples, Nicholas provides a wonderful introduction to the Connection Manager and how to use it as the basis of your ajax-driven workflow.

We asked Wrox Sr. Acquisitions Editor Jim Minatel, Nicholas's editor, if we could share a PDF version of this content on YUIBlog, and he graciously agreed. Thanks to Jim (and to Nicholas) for letting us make this available:
