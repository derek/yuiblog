[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) uses YUI throughout their site, so I recently sat down with three of their web developers to ask them about it. With the cameras rolling I asked Chris Saccheri (Director of Web Development, and their original web developer), Steve Ganz (Principal Web Developer), and Jamie Still how YUI fits into their development process, why they chose YUI, and what it's like to work at LinkedIn ([they're hiring](http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=jobs&trk=hb_ft_work)).

YUI allows LinkedIn to implement usability features that otherwise "wouldn't have been possible within their regular development cycles." It "helps us standardize \[our code\], simplifies everything, and takes care of all the cross-browsers issues so we don't need to continually fight those ourselves." Beyond those reasons, they picked YUI as their JavaScript library "because there's a trust aspect there because it's from Yahoo! and is therefore robust, and has been through the grind and tested on Yahoo!'s own high-traffic sites."

_Sorry, this video is no longer available._

As a personal fan and user of LinkedIn, I'm happy and proud to know YUI is playing a small part in their continuous evolution and improvement.

Thanks to Chris, Steve, Jamie and everybody at LinkedIn for taking the time to record this video!
