### Yahoo Axis, part 2 - Mojito

Last week, [Caridy Patiño](http://twitter.com/caridy) and [Eugene Kashida](http://twitter.com/ekashida) from the Axis Frontend team gave us a high level overview of [Axis](http://axis.yahoo.com/), how and why it combines native and web technology for its mobile offering, and its use of YUI ScrollView and AutoComplete, but we ran out of time before we could get into how Mojito fit into the equation.

They agreed to join us again this week to fill in those details. So for those of you interested in seeing a reference implementation of Mojito, we'll be spending the whole hour on it!

### Recording

The recording is [available in the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T5KMozs6Sc&hd=1).
