<div class="blog" id="blog-content">
	<p>It's been an active several weeks in the YUI world, both here at Yahoo! and <a href="/yuiblog/blog/category/in-the-wild">in the wild</a> &mdash; most prominently, <a href="/yuiblog/blog/2008/02/20/yui-250-released/">YUI 2.5.0 is out</a>, and we've seen a lot of <a href="http://patcavit.com/2008/03/01/yui-uploader-implementation/" title="For example, Pat Cavit takes a deeper look at the new YUI Uplaoder on Zilla Smash.">activity around the new components</a>. Here is some of the news that's caught our eye of late:<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/yahoo!-user-interface-library-yui/book"><img align="right" height="123" hspace="10" src="http://images.packtpub.com/images/100x123/1847192327.png" vspace="5" width="100" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/yahoo!-user-interface-library-yui/book">Dan Wellman's <em>Learning the Yahoo! User Interface Library</em> coming from Packt Publishing</a>: </strong>YUI has been featured in numerous JavaScript books of late, but as far as we know Dan Wellman's upcoming volume from Packt is the first tome dedicated wholly to YUI. We can't wait to get our hands on this one, and we'll certainly share a sample chapter here with you if we can work it out with the publisher. In the meantime, you can <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/yahoo!-user-interface-library-yui/book">preorder the paper version or the e-book from Packt's website</a>.<li><strong><a href="http://justbarebones.blogspot.com/2008/01/announcing-yuirails.html">YUI on Rails</a>:</strong> Rails's support for Prototype and Scriptaculous is well known. But YUI's been making its way onto Rails apps for a long time, and in January Chetan Patil announced <a href="http://justbarebones.blogspot.com/2008/01/announcing-yuirails.html">YUIRails</a>, a project that makes it easier to build with YUI on Rails. According to Chetan, &quot;the intent of this library is to provide a thin layer of logic that glues RJS - PrototypeHelper with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">YUI Connection Manager</a>. In its present form, it provides partial support for RJS Prototypehelper, limited to Element methods and Ajax.Request and Ajax.Updater.&quot;<li><a href="http://stubblog.wordpress.com/2007/12/19/integrating-yui-with-ruby-on-rails/"><strong>More on YUI and Rails</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Stuart Grimshaw adds to the YUI-and-Rails discussion with a thoughtful article, &quot;<a href="http://stubblog.wordpress.com/2007/12/19/integrating-yui-with-ruby-on-rails/">Integrating YUI with Ruby on Rails</a>.&quot; He provides a straightforward approach to bringing YUI into a Rails app: &quot;The engineers at Yahoo! ... [<em>specifically Adam Moore</em> <em>-EM</em>] recently introduced the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/">YUI Loader</a> component, which lets you load any javascript the page may require, and if that happens to be YUI components, it&rsquo;ll also load any dependencies they require too. This is also a great way of integrating YUI with rails, without bloating your app, and without creating convoluted bespoke solutions.<li><strong><a href="http://www.gauravv.com/2008/02/28/yui-250-plugin-for-aptana/">Aptana Plugin for YUI 2.5.0</a>: </strong>Gaurav Verma bumps Aptana support for YUI to the latest version with his <a href="http://www.gauravv.com/2008/02/28/yui-250-plugin-for-aptana/">YUI 2.5.0 Aptana Plugin</a>. Thanks, Gaurav!<li><strong><a href="http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/"><strong>Shadowbox &mdash; super-slick lightbox based on YUI</strong></a>: </strong>Michael J. I. Jackson <a href="http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/">brings you Shadowbox</a>, a genuinely nice interpretation of the much-travelled lightbox concept. We like this one because it's based on and works with YUI and because it's flexible enough to work with any other frontend library you may choose. Slick and <a href="http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/doc/usage.html">well-documented</a> &mdash; a class act.<strong><br /><a href="http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/"><img alt="Shadowbox, by Michael I.

His solution: <a href="http://ojay.othermedia.org/">Ojay</a>. YUI is &quot;a finely crafted library&quot;, Jamse says, whose native idioms are too verbose, and he's offering up Ojay as an open-source sugar layer to provide an alternative syntax option. If you're interested in trying it out, check out James's <a href="http://blog.jcoglan.com/2008/02/22/announcing-ojay-the-nice-way-to-use-yui/">extensive introductory blog post on the project</a>.<li><strong><a href="http://yui4jsf.sourceforge.net/site/index.html">YUI4JSF marches on</a>: </strong><a href="http://www.jroller.com/HazemBlog/entry/yui4jsf_0_6_1_is">Hazem Ahmed Saleh announced on jroller</a> that <a href="http://yui4jsf.sourceforge.net/site/index.html">YUI4JSF 0.6.1</a> is almost here. YUI4JSF wraps many of the YUI utilities and widgets and provides some components even beyond the standard YUI catalog (including Accordion Menu, CommandButton, Ajax CommandButton, CommandLink, Menu Button, AutoComplete, Slider, Calendar, Datatable, Column, Menu, MenuBar, SubMenu, Menuitem, Menu Button Item, TreeView, TabView, Tab, SortList, Panel, Dialog, Simple Dialog, Tooltip, Logger). <li><strong><a href="http://www.labwithleo.com/notes/146">Nick Bouton on The Lab with Leo</a>: </strong>Episode 146 of &quot;The Lab with Leo Laporte&quot; features <a href="http://www.nickbouton.com/">Nick Bouton</a> of OpenRoad Communications in a section entitled &quot;Getting Started with Yahoo User Interface&quot;.<br /><a href="http://www.labwithleo.com/notes/146"><img alt="Nick Bouton on The Lab with Leo." height="98" hspace="0" src="/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/thelab.jpg" vspace="10" width="500" /></a><li><a href="http://www.nickbouton.com/archives/2008/02/14/tutorial-customizing-the-yui-button-widget/"><strong>Nick Bouton helps you customize the YUI Button Control</strong></a><strong>:</strong> More from <a href="http://nickbouton.com/">Nick</a>, who in the past has written about customizing YUI's TabView, as he posts a new tutorial on customizing Todd Kloots's <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/button/">YUI Button Control</a>. Writes Nick: &quot;YUI buttons are...quite handy and make for a really nice user experience if used in the right situations. On top of that, it saves you writing it yourself, and the YUI button sits on top of existing HTML button controls pretty transparently.&quot; His full tutorial is <a href="http://www.nickbouton.com/archives/2008/02/14/tutorial-customizing-the-yui-button-widget/">here</a>.<li><strong><a href="http://www.jroller.com/carlossg/entry/ajax_with_yahoo_ui_components">AJAX with Yahoo UI components and DWR</a>: </strong>Carlos Sanchez writes on jroller <a href="http://www.jroller.com/carlossg/entry/ajax_with_yahoo_ui_components">about his experiences integrating YUI components with DWR</a>: &quot;So far I've used the autocomplete and treeview components, and I have to say they are quite easy to use and very complete. I had used Script.aculo.us autocomplete before, but YUI autocomplete has a lot of configuraiton options and all of them really well documented, like caching or being able to easily use it as a normal dropdown when the user just clicks on the field without typing anything. Event handling is also pretty easy.&quot; More thoughts and <a href="http://www.jroller.com/carlossg/entry/ajax_with_yahoo_ui_components">YUI/DWR sample code here</a>.<li><strong><a href="http://mattsnider.com/javascript/simple-image-popouts/">Matt Snider's Image Popout widget</a>:</strong> Matt Snider, a prolific frontend engineer and <a href="http://mattsnider.com">blogger</a> from <a href="http://mint.com/">Mint.com</a>, offers up this simple <a href="http://mattsnider.com/javascript/simple-image-popouts/">Image Popout widget</a>. In his words: &quot;There are a lot of great libraries with powerful, full-featured in-page popouts, and if you want the kitchen sink, I suggest you use one like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/">YUI&rsquo;s Container</a>. However, sometimes you just want something simple, that works out-of-the-box, requiring little code and next to no setup. For those times I have created a Simple Image Popout widget.&quot; Matt's widget is YUI-based, but he's abstracted it so that it's easy to run on the library of your choice.<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"><strong>Rohit Shah's TabView Widget for Blogger</strong></a><strong>: </strong>If you're a Blogger user, check out <a href="http://bloggingforbread.blogspot.com/2008/02/tabview-in-your-blog-widget-for-blogger.html">Rohit Shah's extensive tutorial</a> that will get you up and running with Matt Sweeney's YUI TabView Control on your blog. Rohit walks you through, step by step, including all of the Blogger-specific code you'll need.<li><strong><a href="http://snoopdogg.com/">YUI celebrity sighting</a>: </strong>Snoop Dogg's new album is <em>Trippin' on Ego </em>(due out March 11), and it was certainly a trip (of the best kind) to see YUI in use on <a href="http://snoopdogg.com/">http://snoopdogg.com/</a>. Snoop's web crew has the YUI Core (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yahoo/">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/">Dom</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/">Event</a>) along with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/element/">Element</a> running. (Thanks to <a href="http://www.vodkaforbreakfast.com/archives/2008/02/05/doggy-dog-framework/">VodkaForBreakfast</a> for the tip.)<br /><a href="http://snoopdog.com/"><img alt="YUI running on Snoopdog.com." height="342" hspace="0" src="/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/snoop.jpg" vspace="10" width="500" /></a><li><a href="http://iphoneminds.com/2007/12/basic-ajax-scroll-animation-wyui.html"><strong>iPhone-style Ajax scroll animations</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Jay at <a href="http://iPhoneMinds.com">iPhoneMinds.com</a> was not satisfied with the iPhone-style content scrollers he found out there: &quot;Going through someone else's code is an art, you have to get into the developers mind and discover what he or she was thinking when writing the piece. While scavenging the Internet for an AJAX scroll animation, similar to that of the iPhone, I was so disgusted by the code I saw that I just wrote my own.&quot; <a href="http://iphoneminds.com/2007/12/basic-ajax-scroll-animation-wyui.html">Check out the fruits of his labor here</a>.<li><strong><a href="http://blog.amodernfable.com/2008/02/12/its-a-launch/">EY Insight, powered by YUI</a>: </strong>Adam McIntyre on A Modern Fable <a href="http://blog.amodernfable.com/2008/02/12/its-a-launch/">talks about the launch</a> of <a href="http://www.ey.com/eyinsight/index.html">EY Insight</a>, a new site from Ernst and Young geared toward students interested in an EY career. What makes it special? In Adam's words: &quot;It&rsquo;s one of the first sites I&rsquo;ve seen that mashes up JavaScript (in this case YUI) and full-screen Flash video. There&rsquo;s some pretty complicated Flash/JavaScript interaction going on, and I really haven&rsquo;t seen too much like it. (Thanks SWFObject and Alisdair Mills). This is the biggest YUI app that I&rsquo;ve launched, and brings a nice, high profile to how much fidelity you can get out of a JavaScript app.&quot;<li><strong><a href="http://spindrop.us/2008/01/27/yui-autocomplete-the-easy-way/">&quot;YUI AutoComplete the easy way&quot;</a>:</strong> Dave Dash at <a href="http://spindrop.us/">spindrop</a> likes the feature richness of Jenny Han Donnelly's YUI AutoComplete, but he wanted to make it even easier to use &mdash; and he kindly took the time to <a href="http://spindrop.us/2008/01/27/yui-autocomplete-the-easy-way/">share the love with everyone on his blog</a>.<li><strong><a href="http://www.rumsby.net/content/blog/walter/posts/2008/02/03/Dust+Me+Selector">Advice on using the Selector Utility</a>:</strong> Walter Rumsby took some time getting to know Matt Sweeney's YUI Selector Utility, profiling it against alternative element selection methods, and came away with some <a href="http://www.rumsby.net/content/blog/walter/posts/2008/02/03/Dust+Me+Selector">nice advice for people getting started with Selector</a>.<li><strong><a href="http://www.ajaxperformance.com/2008/02/20/yui-profiler/">What to Like about YUI's Profiler</a>: </strong>Ryan Breen takes note of YUI's new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/profiler/">Profiler</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/profilerviewer/">ProfilerViewer</a>: &quot;The profiling model differs significantly from Firebug, which runs as a browser extension and can reach deep into browser internals for its metrics. YUI Profiler is running within the JS sandbox, so the user is required to register specific functions for profiling. This limits the profiling from broad spectrum analysis of the whole application to more targeted measurement, but that also serves to limit the performance overhead of the profiling itself.&quot;<li><a href="http://www.lilyapp.org/"><strong>A visual programming environment for JavaScript authors</strong></a>: <a href="http://www.lilyapp.org/">Lily</a> is described by Bill Orcutt as &quot;a modular framework that allows you to wire together Javascript library components graphically. Currently there are Lily modules that wrap components from the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>, JQuery &amp; Scriptaculous libraries. There are also modules that provide access to the file system, browser storage, network &amp; graphics. Lily programs can be saved as standalone XULRunner applications or as Firefox addons.&quot; You can see an example of YUI usage in Lily <a href="http://blog.lilyapp.org/2007/04/flickryuilightbox.html">in the Flickr/YUI/Lightbox example</a>.<li><strong><a href="http://www.wegoall.com/blog/2008/01/19/polls-yui-charts-rte-and-youtube-plugin/">YouTube plugin for the YUI Rich Text Editor (RTE) from WeGoAll</a>:</strong> Fraternity/sorority website specialist WeGoAll coded up <a href="http://www.wegoall.com/code/yuiplugindemo">this nice YouTube plugin</a> for <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor">Dav Glass's YUI Rich Text Editor</a>. Not that the studious lads and lasses in the Greek system have time to watch web video...<li><strong><a href="http://newspond.com/">Newspond launches, powered by YUI</a>: </strong>Another YUI-powered site that launched recently is news-aggregator <a href="http://newspond.com/">Newspond</a>.
