As I had to upgrade my personal blog to the newest WordPress version (and my old theme had been hacked to death), I chose to start from scratch with a WordPress theme.

\[[You can download the new theme here](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/autogridminimal.zip).\]

As I am a lazy person and I think blogging is first and foremost about content and availability, I wanted to re-use as much as possible the good stuff other people have done and then tweak it a bit to fit my needs.

Voilå! YUI autogrid minimal, a WordPress theme based heavily on [YUI's Grids CSS](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/) and [Base CSS](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/base/) with a few changes to fit the HTML that WordPress creates for you.

To work around the issue of YUI Grids being optimized for a certain resolution, I used the [autogrids trick blogged here previously](/yuiblog/blog/2008/06/25/autogrids/).

This is what this WordPress theme gives you:

-   clean, simple markup
-   a grids layout that changes with the available browser space
-   a fixed right side menu for easy access of the search and pages
-   an hCard in the footer to download to Outlook or Mail
-   Nice, easy-to-read typography without any fancy distractions

What it does not give you (as I hadn't had time to look into these):

-   Ajax that nobody really needs
-   the new WordPress enhancements like the dynamic sidebar
-   pop-up comments (come on, this is 2008!)

You can see a few messier, older versions of this theme at work on [my personal blog](/yuiblog/blog/2008/06/25/autogrids/) and on [Scripting Enabled, the event I am organising about accessibility hacking later this year](http://scriptingenabled.org).
