Not all talks at [YUIConf 2012](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf) were directly related to features of YUI. One such talk focused instead on the need for testing code entitled "Write Code That Works" from [Reid Burke](http://reidburke.com/2012/11/18/yeti-at-yuiconf/). This was a very popular talk that was highly rated by attendees. If you develop for the web, you'll find this talk entertaining and insightful.

In this YUIConf 2012 presentation, the YUI team member Reid Burke talks about testing software and writing code that works. His talk is richly illustrated with demos of the tools that Reid has built for testing JavaScript in the browser and includes a discussion of the software testing philosophy and the special place that testing holds in the development process.
