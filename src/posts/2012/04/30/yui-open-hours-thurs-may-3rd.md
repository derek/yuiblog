### Fiddling Around With DataTable

To me, it feels like every other Open Hours is about DataTable, but I guess that's not actually true. So let's talk about DataTable!

In particular, I want to talk about two things:

1.  Tips and tricks with column configurations and cell formatters
2.  What's fast, what's slow, and how to maximize DT performance

It will be a lot of live coding on [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/), though I'll try to have a few examples of things prepped. If there's a particular example you'd like to see, a formatting question you'd like answered, or generally any other DT question or feedback, please bring it.

### Recording

The recording is [available in the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/yuilibrary/), though the quality didn't come out very well.
