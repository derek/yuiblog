In this talk from [YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010), YUI 3 AutoComplete author Ryan Grove ([@yaypie](http://twitter.com/yaypie)) takes you on a whirlwind tour of some of the many autocomplete patterns made possible by this component (which is coming in the soon-to-be-released YUI 3.3.0) and provides a deep dive into its powerful new [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/ "Yahoo! Query Language - YDN") integration, filtering, and highlighting capabilities.
