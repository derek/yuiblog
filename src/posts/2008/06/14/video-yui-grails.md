[![Scott Davis talks about Groovy and Rails at the Rich Web Experience.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/scottdavis.png)](http://www.therichwebexperience.com/media.jsp?id=40)

[Mastering Grails](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=mastering+grails) columnist (and author of books on topics ranging from Java to GIS) Scott Davis gave a fantastic talk on using [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) with [Grails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grails_\(Framework\)) at the 2007 Rich Web Experience in San Jose. Thanks to Jay Zimmerman and his No Fluff Just Stuff conference team, [that talk is now available freely on video from the RWE website](http://www.therichwebexperience.com/media.jsp?id=40).
