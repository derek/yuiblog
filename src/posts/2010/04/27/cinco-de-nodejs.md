BayJax organizer [Gonzalo Cordero](http://twitter.com/goonieiam) has announced that it's time for another [BayJax](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/ "BayJax - The Bay Area Ajax and JavaScript Meetup (Palo Alto, CA) - Meetup.com"), and this time we'll be celebrating the explosion of server-side JavaScript with Cinco de Node.js at Yahoo!. We have three fantastic speakers: Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.js; Elijah Insua, creator of one of the major DOM abstractions for Node; and Dav Glass, a YUI engineer who has been blogging about his work getting YUI 3 running under Node.

Please join us on May 5th @Yahoo! HQ from 5:30pm to 9:00 p.m. As Gonzalo puts it: "Sombreros, ponchos and luchador outfits are encouraged." [RSVP on the BayJax Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/calendar/13308905/?from=list&offset=0).

Ryan describes his talk this way:

> It is well known that event loops rather than threads are required for high-performance servers. Javascript is a language unencumbered of threads and designed specifically to be used with asynchronous evented I/O, making it an attractive means of programming server software. Node.js ties together the V8 Javascript compiler with an event loop, a thread pool for making blocking system calls, and a carefully designed HTTP parser to provide a browser-like interface to creating fast server-side software. This talk will explain Node's design and how to get started with it."

Elijah, who will be Skyping in from New York, will talk about his project, [jsdom](http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom "tmpvar's jsdom at master - GitHub"), which provides the essential DOM abstractions that allow client-side, DOM-dependent JavaScript to run under Node.js. This is an important part of the paradigm shift, enabling levels of server- and client-side code reuse never possible before and allowing progressive enhancement to be a natural, efficient outgrowth of our development environment.

Dav will carry this theme forward, showing in practical terms how the foundation of Node.js, the abstractions in jsdom, and Dav's own work to add BOM features to jsdom enable a full implementation like YUI to illustrate some of the enormous promise of this kind of development.
