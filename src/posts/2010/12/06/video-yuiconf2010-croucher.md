-   [**Norbert Lindenberg:** Internationalizing Applications Using YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-lindenberg) — On the web as in the real world, every language is a minority language. To reach a majority of users, your software will need to support multiple languages and be adapted to the needs and expectations of different cultures. In this session from YUIConf 2010, Yahoo! internationalization architect Norbert Lindenberg discusses how to do this building on YUI 3.
-   [**Tilo Mitra:** Handling Data in YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-mitra) — Yahoo! engineering intern Tilo Mitra introduces the YUI 3 data-lifecycle toolkit, including facilities for data sources, schemas, and the new-for-3.3.0 YUI DataTable widget.
-   [**Matt Taylor:** YUI 3 & Node.js for JavaScript View Rendering on Client or Server](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-taylor) — Most web application frameworks have some type of templating engine that accepts two things: (1) data, (2) template, and returns HTML to be assembled into an HTTPResponse. The promise of Node.js and YUI 3 running server-side is that a new era of frameworks is possible in which view rendering on the client and server is implemented with the same JavaScript-based code.
-   [**Gonzalo Cordero:** A Preview of YUI 3 TreeView](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-cordero) — Yahoo! frontend engineer and YUI contributor Gonzalo Cordero discusses his TreeView implementation which was recently posted to the YUI 3 Gallery. This lighter incarnation of Treeview is built upon YUI 3's Parent-Child module and already boasts a feature-rich and easy-to-implement API and a robust set of events.
