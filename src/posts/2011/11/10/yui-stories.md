At YUIConf 2011 last week, we set up a video camera and invited attendees to tell us how they use YUI and why they chose it for their projects. We were thrilled to hear their stories, and we'd love to hear yours as well! After checking out [the video](http://youtu.be/F-krPD9fRsk?hd=1), leave a comment and tell us how you use YUI.
