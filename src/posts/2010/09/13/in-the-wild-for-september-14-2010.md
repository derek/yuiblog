With [YUI 3.2.0 hot off the presses](/yuiblog/2010/09/07/yui-3-2-0/) and [Anthony Pipkin on fire with new submissions in the burgeoning YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/user/apipkin), it's been an active period in the YUI community. We have our eye on the upcoming YUI Conf 2010 ([we hope you'll join us](/yuiblog/2010/09/09/register-now-for-yuiconf-2010/)), too.

-   **[Flint Studio on YUI 2 CSS Grids](http://www.flintstudio.com/blog/some-great-web-development-applications-and-frameworks/):** Writes Ross at Flint Studio in his survey of great web development tools: "I started using Yahoo’s YUI Grids CSS framework nearly a year ago, and I’ve continued to do so as it has been a reliable performer across all browsers and has saved me much time laying out my Websites. It is slightly less flexible than other CSS frameworks like 960 and Blueprint, but because of this, it is also more enjoyable to use as there is less to learn. I find the markup to be more semantic with YUI than the other CSS frameworks as well, so thats a large plus in my book." [#](#yuiBlogWild-505)

YUI is an incredibly feature-rich JavaScript library with a LOT of functionality but getting your head around all of those features can be tough. The YUI team wants to help developers get up and running more quickly and announced yesterday the release of SimpleYUI; a basic and more streamlined version of the YUI library." SimpleYUI is a rollup of common, core modules in the library, with the added twist that it self-instantiates -- making it a little simpler and more accessible for those new to YUI.

Now with the addition of SimpleYUI rapid, lightweight development is made even simpler. Best of all, those used to jQuery-style syntax can start using YUI 3 today while learning the intricacies of developing larger applications." [#](#yuiBlogWild-507)

Native apps have, in a sense, spoiled users; with things like drag-and-drop and basic touch gesture recognition almost laughably simple to implement in native apps, web app developers are left to hack in such features themselves or risk having their app seem dated from the get-go. Today Yahoo! is looking to make things a bit less painful with the latest release of their open-source User Interface library, YUI."

If you’re keen to get your hands dirty now, one of the many JavaScript frameworks can help. In particular, YUI 3 enables support through the “selector-css3″ module however documentation at this time is limited. I’ve had a brief and by no means comprehensive [play with some of them](http://playground.codeinfront.com/examples/yui/3/modules/dom/selector-css3.html "External site: View the demo.").

Would you like to have access to this same functionality without having to do anything? Here at DeVSeO we use Twitter for a number of things and in a number of places. I decided to help you guys out by turning one of ours scripts that we use here into a fully customisable release so that you, too, can have Twitter on your own site with absolutely no coding ability whatsoever. It couldn't be easier." [Alex has a demo page here](http://www.devseo.co.uk/page/tweetywall). [#](#yuiBlogWild-513)

-   **[Alex Hall's Star Ratings Widget for YUI 2.x](http://www.devseo.co.uk/blog/view/star-rating-script-with-yui):** This isn't brand-new, but I missed it when it was originally posted, and you can never have too many good options for implementing the Star Ratings design pattern. Alex Hall took an existing one and built on it: "I really needed a nice little star rating system with YUI for this blog...and after a single search in [Google](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=star rating yui) I found Ville Saavuori's [Star Rating Script for YUI](http://www.unessa.net/en/hoyci/projects/yui-star-rating/ "YUI Star Rating Script By Ville Saavuori"), which is perfect for the job I needed... However, for a new project I am undertaking I realised that his implementation was not going to work for multiple rating systems on the same page because it is based on ID's, and as we all know, you can only have one ID reference in the DOM on one page. So I started to rework the script to allow for more rating systems on a single page using classes instead of ID's." Alex's [example page](http://www.devseo.co.uk/examples/rating-example/) is here.

-   **[Alex Hall's YUILight Spotlighting Widget for YUI 2](http://www.devseo.co.uk/blog/view/yuilight-spotlight-your-page-elements-with-yui):** Writes Alex: "YUILight is a customisable YUI Script that will highlight an element on your page simply by applying a class of 'yuilight' to that element. When that element is clicked and focused on, everything else on the page will be covered by a mask and that single element will stand out from the rest. It is a very simple script to implement only requiring two javascript files and no CSS! The options for customising the script can be found at the top of the javascript file (which is fully commented for you). At the moment you can change the generic background colour (when no background colour has been specified for the element). This option is so that your element doesn't disappear with the text. You can also configure the opacity of the mask element and the animation speed that it shows and hides. I will be adding more customisable fields later on but if you have any requests please feel free to leave them in the comments section at the bottom of this post."

This book explains the full feature set of the YUI library, and you’ll realize that it’s the perfect foundation to build on top of. The authors do a really great job of showing in depth examples that teach you how the components work. I particularly liked reading the chapter on DataSource and DataTable." [#](#yuiBlogWild-508)

If you have read of my other blogs here on DeVSeO you may notice that I prefer the YUI javascript library by Yahoo for all of my javascript.
