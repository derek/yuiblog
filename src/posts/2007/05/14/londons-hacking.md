In case you haven't heard yet, Yahoo!'s [Hack Day](http://hackday.org/) is coming to Europe. I can hardly do more justice to this event than [Tom Coates has done on his blog](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2007/04/a_hack_for_europe/), but here are some important details:

-   **Are you invited?** Naturally.
-   **Where is it****?** Alexandra Palace, London.
-   **When is it?** June 16 and 17, 2007.
-   **How much does it cost?** It's free.
-   **Will Beck be playing?** Hey, it's London — there will be great music in the vicinity, if not at the Hack Day.
-   **How do I sign up?** [Hackday.org](http://hackday.org/) has a [registration page](http://hack.eventwax.com/hack-day/register).

[![YUI engineer Nate Koechley.](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/26680139_da9140291d_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/natekoechley/26680139/)I'm pleased to report that, as with Hack Day in Sunnyvale, YUI will be well represented. YUI engineer [Nate Koechley](http://nate.koechley.com/blog/), author of YUI's [Reset](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/), [Fonts](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/), and [Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/) libraries, will be on the speakers roster along with Yahoo! UK's [Christian Heilmann](http://icant.co.uk/).

In Sunnyvale, we saw some great hacks in which YUI helped provide the interface for a variety of Yahoo! web services, and we hope to see more of the same in London. With the intensely creative and committed web development community in the London area, I'm sure that this event will be a memorable one. Can the London event top [a handbag that automatically documents your day in pictures and updates your photostream on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/yodelanecdotal/257035585/)? Time will tell. But those of us in Sunnyvale know that when we have our next Hack Day here in California we'll have a whole new bar to clear in our hacking. And we can't wait for that.

Happy hacking, and for those of you in YUI user community in London please track Nate and Christian down and say hello.
