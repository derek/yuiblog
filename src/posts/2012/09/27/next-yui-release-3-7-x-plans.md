The focus for the next release is to add **IE 10** to [YUI's target environments](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/environments/). YUI's unit tests already fare well in IE 10's standard desktop browser mode, but in Windows 8 there are [multiple runtime environments](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Windows-8-JavaScript-Runtimes) (progressively more restrictive) in which we want to make sure YUI is supported.

The next stable release with these improvements will be on **[October 16, 2012](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule)**. The open tickets for this release can be found [here](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/138).

As always, look for updates on schedules, plans, and development discussions on the [YUI3 wiki](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki). Additional information about the specifics of the runtimes is available there as well.
