[![BayJax event at Yahoo! on March 31, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/rossharmes-20100419-101805.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=zakas-hpjs)

The April 2010 edition of the BayJax meetup at Yahoo! featured five speakers, all of whom are co-authors on the new _High Performance JavaScript_ volume from O'Reilly ([free chapter available here](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/07/high-performance-javascript-sample-chapter/)). There were about 200 attendees filling the URLs Cafe in the heart of Yahoo!, and they heard five distinctly interesting takes on web-app performance.
