[![Dav Glass speaks about YUI 3 and Node.js at Yahoo on September 16, 2010.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/dav-node-20100920-100528.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=glass-node)

[Ryan Dahl's work on Node.js](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=dahl-node) — and the community forming around that project — has joined HTML5 as one of the big stories of 2010. YUI engineer Dav Glass has been working to make YUI 3 a powerful ally for Node.js implementers, and in this video he shows you what he's done so far — including demos of progressively enhanced widgets running the same code on client and server. Don't miss this one.

-   [**Alois Reitbauer:** dynaTrace Ajax Edition](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=reitbauer-dynatrace) — dynaTrace provides one of the most powerful tools for analyzing the performance of web applications in Internet Explorer. In this talk, dynaTrace engineer Alois Reitbauer walks through four specific analytic scenarios using the dynaTrace interface.
-   [**Ryan Grove:** Achieving Performance Zen with YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=grove-zen) — Following [codified guidelines](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/) can help you build fast websites, but building applications that are clean, fast and extensible also involves taking a balanced approach to performance at every level of your F2E work. YUI 3 is designed to help you in this process, providing a right-sized abstraction layer with built-in performance magic and a variety of tools that make fast frontend code easy and fun to produce. In this session, we'll explore the zen of performant JavaScript in the YUI 3 world and introduce you to some of the powerful tools YUI 3 puts at your disposal in every app you write.
-   [**Douglas Crockford:** Crockford on JavaScript -- Scene 6: Loopage](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-loopage) — Software development is hampered by a specific set of design mistakes that were made in the first programming languages and repeated in everything that has been done since. And, somewhat miraculously, JavaScript is going to make it right, radically transforming the way we write applications. Again. In the Loop of History, it has all happened before, but it has never happened like this. This is why you should care about the emergence of server-side JavaScript and the excitement around projects like Node.js – not because they're at the sharp end of a trend, but because they're paving the road toward the next big revolution in software.
