We're getting ready for [YUI's 2nd Birthday in a couple of weeks here in Sunnyvale](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/415087), and we wanted to let you know that [Sophie Major and the Yahoo! Developer Network in London are getting ready for a little get-together, too](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/429276), for those of you who can't make it to California on the 26th:

> We'd like to invite the web development community in London for a birthday celebration for the YUI Library and Yahoo Pattern Library.
> 
> At 6.30, we'll be broadcasting a message from the YUI/YPattern guys in the US and there will also be a short talk by Christian Heilmann
> 
> There will be beer and snacks, so please come along, hear what we are up to in 2008 and help us celebrate!
> 
> Sadly, there is limited space so [please register here on Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/429276). There are 85 places and it's first come, first served.

If you'll be in Sunnyvale, we have limited space here, too, but we opened up a few extra spaces this morning, so [head on over to Upcoming to save yourself a spot](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/415087/) (and a cool YUI t-shirt!).
