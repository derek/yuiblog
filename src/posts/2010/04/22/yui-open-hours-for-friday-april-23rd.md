The next installment of YUI: Open Hours is tomorrow, Friday the 23rd!

The first Open Hours was a huge success, with about 30 people joining in and some great conversation and feedback for both Lauren Smith's [YUISand Gallery module](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/yuisand) as well as for YUI.

The time will be the same as before, 10am - 12pm PDT. The primary agenda item for this week will be an introduction and code review of [Eric Ferraiuolo](http://twitter.com/ericf)'s [Component Manager Gallery module](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/base-componentmgr). I'm also going to start opening the conversations with a "YUI 3 tip or trick" of sorts.

This week, we'll be joined by fellow YUIer [Satyen Desai](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets) ([@dezziness](http://twitter.com/dezziness)), the lead architect behind the [Attribute](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/attribute/), [Base](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/base/), and [Widget](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/widget/) infrastructure pieces in YUI 3. (If you'd like to meet Satyen before the event, [you can do that on YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets).)

Like before, the plan is to use Adobe Connect for screen sharing and do voice over a conference bridge. This is the info for joining in:

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (non-US participants, email me for a local number)
2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

And as mentioned with the first YUI: Open Hours, you can keep up to date with the upcoming schedule and topics by following [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) on Twitter or subscribing to the [YUI Event Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/calendar/#calendar).

If this is the first you've read about YUI: Open Hours, it's an open forum with myself and other YUI team members and some great minds from the YUI community. You can [read more about it here](/yuiblog/2010/04/08/introducing-yui-open-hours/).

Hope to see you there!
