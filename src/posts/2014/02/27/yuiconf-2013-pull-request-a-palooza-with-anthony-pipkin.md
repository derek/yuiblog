Today we have another great YUIConf 2013 video to share with you. This one features [Anthony Pipkin](https://twitter.com/apipkin) talking about the anatomy of a perfect pull request in a talk entitled "[Great Pull Reqests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuN1X8MEaZs)" followed by the "Pull-Request-A-Palooza" as a Q&A session on pull requests and issues. You can check out the [previous talk](/yuiblog/blog/2014/02/24/yuiconf-2013-bill-walker-on-firefox-marketplace-breaking-the-stranglehold-of-app-stores/) as well as all of the YUIConf 2013 talks with our [playlist on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKP9DUCzZorde6sLWHJ3GNd-6VrGrbqm).
