Here at YUI HQ, we're working toward [the next major release of YUI, YUI 3.1.0](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=2876). Yesterday [we shared some YUI 3 loader work that Adam Moore has done for 3.1.0](/yuiblog/2010/03/11/yui-2-in-3-coming-soon/). His "YUI 2 in 3" project allows you to use components like [YUI 2 DataTable](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/) simply and efficiently in YUI 3. Meanwhile, his loader improvements also mean you can bring in [YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) modules like [Storage Lite](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/storage-lite) with the same ease and efficiency. 3.1.0 will also mark the GA release of [Satyen Desai's component/widget foundation for YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets).

We're also running the [YUI 3 Gallery Contest](/yuiblog/yui3gallerycontest2010/), the winner getting a JSConf conference pass and $500 at Expedia.com to help with travel. You've got two full weekends left of hacking before the deadline!

In the meantime, there's been a lot going on in the community — here are a few of the things we've noted recently:

-   **[In the YUI 3 Gallery -- Jeff Craig's Slideshow Module](http://blog.foxxtrot.net/2010/03/introducing-gallery-slideshow-for-yui3.html):** Jeff Craig, author of the [Chromahash](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/chromahash) and [Crypto](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/crypto) modules, has released his [Slideshow](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/slideshow) module for the [YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/).  His [writeup on his blog](http://blog.foxxtrot.net/2010/03/introducing-gallery-slideshow-for-yui3.html) provides a good introduction to the component, which he used for the [Washington State University commencement site](http://commencement.wsu.edu/Commencement/Apps/HomePage.ASP).
    
    > Recently, at work, we had a desire to update an instance of a flash-based slideshow widget on our [commencement](http://commencement.wsu.edu/) website. This widget did absolutely nothing special, but the real problem we had was that, we didn’t actually have a license for Flash, and the way the slideshow had been built, we needed to be able to build the SWF file from scratch in order to update the order. Since our users rarely come to us with anything that isn’t some sort of emergency, we had to take the flash files to another department to make our quick change and compile a new SWF.

Because, after all, JavaScript is the language of the web, isn't it? You can play with the latest git version of the [JS port online here](http://tools.w3clubs.com/cssmin/). I'm also happy to report that the JS port is now used in [PageSpeed](http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/) and [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) (as you probably know Firefox extensions are written in JavaScript)."

-   **[Satyam's YQLDataSource for YUI 2](http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.7.0/yql.html):** "Thanks to Jonathan LeBlanc's [article on the YUI Blog](/yuiblog/2009/06/17/yui-and-yql/) I thought that it would be cool to have a YQLDataSource to make it easier to use [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/ "Yahoo! Query Language - YDN") data in [YUI 2 DataTable](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/ "YUI 2: DataTable"), [YUI 2 Charts](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/ "YUI 2: Charts") and [YUI 2 AutoComplete](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/ "YUI 2: AutoComplete"). The table below is built using such a DataSource...The YQLDataSource does not require any parameters. It will automatically use the [YUI 2 Get Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/ "YUI 2: Get Utility") to access the YQL servers using JSON format and providing a suitable callback. The DataSource just needs to be instanced like: `var ds = new YAHOO.util.YQLDataSource();`." Check out [Satyam's full documented example](http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.7.0/yql.html "YQL Query") for all the details.

-   **[German-language Screencast on Using YUI in DreamWeaver CS4](http://dreamweaver-screencast.de/blog/dreamweaver-ep57-yui-treeview-konfigurieren/):** According to the author, 'In diesem Film zeigt Ihnen der Trainer die Verwendung und Konfiguration des Web Widgets “YUI TreeView“. Sie lernen die HTML-Struktur dieses Widgets kennen." This is a beautifully produced screencast on using CS4's YUI support, focusing on the YUI TreeView Control.

-   **[Simple File Upload in Grails (using YUI Connection Manager)](http://simonpalmer.com/2010/03/05/really-simple-file-upload-in-grails/):** [Simon Palmer shows you](http://simonpalmer.com/2010/03/05/really-simple-file-upload-in-grails/) how he leveraged Thomas Sha's [YUI Connection Manager](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/) and Matthew Taylor's slick [Grails UI](http://www.grails.org/plugin/grails-ui) package to add asynchronous file upload to his Grails project. (Note: You may be able to lighten the kweight of this solution by not including the full utilities.js package but rather [cherrypicking the components you need](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/?connection&MIN) -- in this case, that might result in just `<script type="text/javascript" src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.8.0r4/build/yahoo/yahoo-min.js&2.8.0r4/build/event/event-min.js&2.8.0r4/build/connection/connection-min.js"></script>`.

Jobling on Watching YUI Theater](http://blog.cpjobling.org/2010/03/yui-library.html):** Writes Chris: "This last week or so I've been watching a lot of Yahoo! [YUI Theatre](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) videos on JavaScript, starting with Douglas Crockford's excellent five-part series [Crockford on JavaScript](/yuiblog/crockford/) and ending yesterday with Christian Heillman's inspiring talk on [YQL and YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=heilmann-yql). This has inspired me to explore how I can use [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) (a JavaScript library) in the next version of my _Proman_ dissertation project management application which will be needed for 2010-2011 allocation round in May. If it works out, there'll also be some new teaching material for next year's Web Applications module (EG-259). I'll post more in the under the tag YUI on the [Proman, Man](http://promanman.blogspot.com/search/label/yui) blog as I get to grips with this stuff."
