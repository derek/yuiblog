At the February 6, 2012 [BayJax](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/) event at Yahoo!, Flickr Frontend Engineer Stephen Woods ([@ysaw](http://twitter.com/ysaw)) shared his hard-won advice for building responsive touch-based interfaces using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. He also revealed how Star Trek: The Next Generation predicted the need for instant user feedback in a touch-based UI and how Tivo's slow UI was made bearable by a simple "bloop" sound.
