At YUIConf in November we released a preview of YUI 3.3.0, our next major release on the [YUI 3 codeline](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/ "YUI 3 — Yahoo! User Interface Library"). We're now up to our third preview release, and if you have some time over the winter holidays to help us kick the tires we'd love for you to give it a spin. You can use the [YUI 3.3.0pr1 seed file from the CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.3.0pr3/build/yui/yui-min.js) to get started, [download the distribution from YUILibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/download.php?file=cda21a97fc509048951c5709818150e4 "YUI Library :: Downloads"), or check out the [3.3.0pr3 distribution hosted on YUIBlog](/yuiblog/sandbox/yui/3.3.0pr3/ "The Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI) 3.3.0") (note: performance is quite sluggish on YUIBlog due to the lack of combo-handling; rest assured that your CDN-driven implementations generally will be faster than corresponding 3.2.0 usage).

Some of new things to look for in this release:

-   [all-new AutoComplete (beta)](/yuiblog/sandbox/yui/3.3.0pr3/examples/autocomplete/index.html "Library Examples: AutoComplete")
-   [all-new Charts (beta)](/yuiblog/sandbox/yui/3.3.0pr3/examples/charts/index.html "Library Examples: Charts"), powered by SVG, Canvas and VML
-   [all-new DataTable (beta)](/yuiblog/sandbox/yui/3.3.0pr3/examples/datatable/index.html "Library Examples: DataTable"), the beginnings of a more modular upgrade from the popular YUI 2 component
-   [new Dial control (beta)](/yuiblog/sandbox/yui/3.3.0pr3/examples/dial/index.html "Library Examples: Dial"), an innovative take on a finite range control or slider created by Yahoo! designer Jeff Conniff
-   [all-new Resize utility (beta)](/yuiblog/sandbox/yui/3.3.0pr3/examples/resize/image-resize.html "YUI Library Examples: Resize: 8-way Image Resize"), provided by Eduardo Lundgren of Liferay, coauthor with Nate Cavanaugh of the YUI 3-based [AlloyUI](http://alloy.liferay.com/ "Alloy UI - A project of Liferay") extensions available in the [YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show "YUI Library :: Gallery"). (You can meet Eduardo and Nate in this [AlloyUI whirlwind tour shot at YUIConf 2010](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=yuiconf2010-alloy "Video: Nate Cavanaugh and Eduardo Lundgren — A Whirlwind Tour of AlloyUI Components in the YUI 3 Gallery (YUI Theater)").)

There is much more to love about YUI 3.3.0, and we'll be sharing more information as the GA date nears. At present, we're aiming for a release window in the second week of January. We welcome your feedback on the preview in the [YUI forums](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/ "YUI Library :: Forums :: Index page") and in [the ticket database](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ "YUI 3 :: YUI Library") if you find issues of concern when you test out your own implementation with the new release.
