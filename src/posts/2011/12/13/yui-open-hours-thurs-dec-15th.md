### YUI 3.5.0 PR1

[YUI 3.5.0 PR1 is now available](/yuiblog/blog/2011/12/12/yui-3-5-0-pr1-is-now-available-on-cdn/)! This is the first of three Preview Releases for 3.5.0.

For this Open Hours we'll be highlighting what's in PR1 and discussing how _you_ can get involved to make sure 3.5.0 is rock solid. We'll also be asking for a show-of-hands from the awesome developers who've already started using 3.5.0 PR1 (which is [on the CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.5.0pr1/build/yui/yui-min.js)). Come Thursday, don't get caught with your hand down :)

Also, the [YUI Library Staging site](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/) has been updated with the newest user guides and API docs, and in response to the feedback from [the last Open Hours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxZbbxq53tc&list=UUTHcgWOTU6gPje1g_U29tfQ), we're now using our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki) to track [ongoing development discussions](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Ongoing-Development-Discussions).

### Recording

The recording is [available on the YUILibrary YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE2-oQJY-kQ).
