If you are reading this blog post, then we've survived the end of the world, and you can start thinking about more immediate concerns. One of those concerns may be security for your website, and we have just the ticket for you in the form of our latest [YUIConf 2012](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf) talk from [Bishan Kochar](http://lanyrd.com/profile/b1shan/). Keep up with our latest video releases on [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByU2zn9DmAA&list=PLjKP9DUCzZooMmiSJ_nmsLIReOZp0Uomz).

In this demo-oriented talk from YUIConf 2012, the Yahoo! web security engineer Bishan presents both common and not so common security issues arising out of unsafe YUI coding. He analyzes real world vulnerable examples and follows with code demos that show the correct way of securing those with YUI. Bishan also talks about good security patterns that can eliminate a number of frontend vulnerabilities that are seen today.
