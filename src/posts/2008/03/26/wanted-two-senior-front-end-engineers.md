For the past year and a half, I've been working on the [My Yahoo!](http://my.yahoo.com) team to create the next generation of the most popular personalized homepage on the Web. There have been a lot of challenges along the way. We created complex interactions using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, all while using semantic markup. Once the base functionality was complete, we found that the performance wasn't up to par and an arduous investigation began. Over the course of several months, we inspected every line of code that was sent to the client, ultimately finding that we could trim almost 200kb without sacrificing functionality. We met with [Victor Tsaran](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/514676) from the Yahoo! accessibility group to ensure that those using screen readers could use the application. And when the dust had settled, we got a [great review from PC Magazine](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2255785,00.asp). So it's with a slightly heavy heart that I announce that I'm moving on from My Yahoo!...

But I'm not going far. I'll be moving over onto the [Yahoo! front page](http://www.yahoo.com) to work on one of the most visited sites in the world. I'm really looking forward to the new challenges that await me here. The requirements for such a high-traffic site are stricter than any other place I've worked before. It is absolutely not an option for the frontpage to go down or become unavailable, nor is it acceptable for any performance bottlenecks to affect the user experience. I anticipate a lot of exciting work coming my way very soon.

Both My Yahoo! and the front page are part of the FrontDoors organization, which also includes [Yahoo! Buzz](http://buzz.yahoo.com) and the browser [Toolbar](http://toolbar.yahoo.com/). Together, our job is to create the most compelling start points on the Internet. There are a lot of challenges ahead for all of us and we'd love for you to help. Both My Yahoo! and the front page are looking for great front end engineers to continue pushing browser limits and create great user experiences. If you'd like to be a part of the way that millions of people enter the Yahoo! network every day, we'd love to have you.

The open positions are for senior front end engineers. For more information, please see our job postings:
