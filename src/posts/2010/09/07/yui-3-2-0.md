The YUI team is pleased to announce the GA release of [YUI 3.2.0](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/ "YUI 3 — Yahoo! User Interface Library"), a significant update to YUI's JavaScript and CSS components. This release features a host of performance improvements and major new support for mobile devices with touch UIs.

_The Gesture module in YUI 3.2.0 brings touch support to a wide range of YUI-powered interactions, including Drag and Drop and Slider._

There are two ways to get started with the new release:

-   **Use from the CDN:** YUI 3.2.0 is available on the Yahoo! CDN via the 3.2.0 version tag — so you can reference the new release content via filepaths like `[http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.2.0/build/yui/yui-min.js](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.2.0/build/yui/yui-min.js)`. Switch to the seed file for the new release and all subsequent `use()` statements will load YUI 3.2.0.
-   **Download the release:** Download YUI 3.2.0 from [YUILibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/), including source code and examples for all components — including those new to this release.
-   **[Explore the examples:](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/ "YUI 3: Index of Library Examples")** YUI examples are a good way to get a feeling for how the library works and the range of functionality it covers.

### Noteworthy Changes in YUI 3.2.0

George Puckett has rolled up [the high-level list of changes in YUI 3.2.0](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/wiki/ReadMe/RollUp_3.2.0 "YUI 3 :: YUI Library"); [you can also check in on our progress addressing issues in the bug database](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/38 "Tickets Addressed in 3.2.0 :: YUI 3 :: YUI Library}"). Here are some of the new and updated components featured in the 3.2.0:

-   **[SimpleYUI](/yuiblog/blog/2010/09/03/coming-inyui-3-2-0-simpleyui/ "Coming in YUI 3.2.0: SimpleYUI » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)")** has been introduced as a convenience module — in addition to rolling up a variety of YUI's most essential features, it creates a global instance (assigned to the global `Y`) that's available for immediate use. This isn't a watered-down YUI...just a convenience for those who want to have a common rollup with standard Ajax-kit functionality.

-   **Intrinsic support for touch events** has been added (`mynode.on("touchstart", function(e) {});`). We've also added a **Gestures module** with two bundled gestures — `flick` and `move` — that work with both touch- and mouse-driven devices. Check out the [Gestures documentation](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/event/#gestures) and [examples](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/event/swipe-gesture.html) for ideas about how to start using Gestures.
-   **YUI's loader now supports capability-based loading.** This allows us to segregate, for example, IE-specific code into separate submodules and allow the Loader to bundle that code only for browsers that require it. We're leveraging this new feature to avoid shipping IE-specific code in the Dom module to non-IE browsers, a performance/k-weight boost that will benefit all users of modern browsers with no code change required.
-   **YUI 3's animation portfolio now supports transitions via the [Transition module](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/transition)**, providing browser normalization for this powerful, hardware-accelerated (where available) technique for handling transitions; [check out this example for sample code](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/transition/transition-usage.html "YUI Library Examples: Transition: Using Node Transitions"). The [Animation module](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/anim/), in its most basic form, has a streamlined dependency tree for modern browsers, significantly reducing the k-weight for simple animation in better browsers.
-   YUI 3.2.0 debuts a **new beta version of [YUI's CSS Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/cssgrids/)** component, and you can begin exploring this new approach to Grids in the preview release. [The examples are the best place to start](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/cssgrids/ "YUI 3 Library Examples: CSS Grids").
-   [![YUI ScrollView, new in YUI 3.2.0](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/scrollview.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/scrollview/index.html)We worked with **Michael Johnston of the Yahoo! Mobile Engineering team** to bring a **new (beta) [ScrollView widget](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/scrollview/)** to YUI 3.2.0. ScrollView provides a scrolling pane implementation familiar to users of native Apple iOS applications, emulating the elasticity of the element's constraints when scrolled to the beginning or ending limit. You'll see [in the 3.2.0 examples for ScrollView](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/scrollview/index.html "Library Examples: ScrollView") that this component is device-neutral, working well with a mouse as well as with touch events on your Android or iOS device.
-   The **[Uploader component](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/uploader)** from YUI 2 is now part of the YUI 3 family as well, debuting as a beta in 3.2.0.
-   **[Editor (beta) for YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/editor/):** Editor debuts in YUI 3 as a base utility layer providing a foundation on which you can create a rich text editing control. This version of Editor does not contain a GUI of any kind — widget chrome will debut in 3.3.0.
-   The History module that debuted with YUI 3.0.0, which was a port of the YUI 2 version, has been deprecated (it remains available in YUI 3.2.0 as `history-deprecated`). **[A new beta History utility debuts in 3.2.0](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/history/), based on Ryan Grove's History Lite module from the YUI 3 Gallery.** [A preview-release example from the new component](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/history/history_tabview.html "YUI Library Examples: History Utility: History + TabView") is a good starting reference.
-   The **[JSONP](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/jsonp/)** and **[YQL Query](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/yql/)** modules from the [YUI 3 Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/ "YUI Library :: Gallery") have become canonical components, debuting as beta in this release.

### More to Come

We're excited about the coming months in YUI development:

-   **YUI Conf 2010 takes place Nov. 8-10 in Sunnyvale**. As usual, there will be a Crockford keynote, talks by some of the brilliant contributors to the YUI 3 Gallery (including Nate Cavanaugh and Eduardo Lundgren of Liferay), and sessions from the YUI core team.
-   **New components and features:** We're hard at work on YUI 3 versions of tools like AutoComplete, DataTable, Button, Charts and Editor, as well as some all-new projects. Expect a preview of 3.3.0, with all new work completed thus far, when you're here for the conference in November.
-   **[Yeti](/yuiblog/blog/2010/08/25/introducing-yeti-the-yui-easy-testing-interface/ "Introducing Yeti: The YUI Easy Testing Interface » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)"), [YUI for Node.js](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/05/running-yui-3-server-side-with-node-js/ "Running YUI 3 Server-Side with Node.js » Yahoo! User Interface Blog (YUIBlog)"), and more:** The team continues to push the envelope with projects aimed at the most promising frontiers in frontend engineering. Reid Burke's Yeti was just launched, allowing command-line cross-browser testing for anyone using YUI Test. Dav Glass's work to make YUI 3 work seamlessly with NodeJS has been documented on the blog and will be an official YUI offering soon. And there's more to come.
