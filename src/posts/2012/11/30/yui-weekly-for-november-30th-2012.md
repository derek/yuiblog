It's been another busy week at YUI as we roll up our sleeves before the holidays kick in. Wherever you live, I hope you are having better weather than we are. Apparently, it's been raining cats and dogs in Sunnyvale for the last few days. I've been in Toronto, and it's been snowing here. Good weather to stay in and code, I suppose! Anyway, let's see what's been happening in YUI this week:

-   YUIConf 2012 videos are rolling out on a regular basis. We had a number of videos out this week: "[The Future of YUI CSS](http://youtu.be/KpyBAQt7hUs)" by Jeff Conniff and Tilo Mitra, "[Attribute Walkthrough](http://youtu.be/t_UkPEAA_KI)" by Luke Smith, and "[When not to use YUI](http://youtu.be/8cTz73zdDuc)" by Ryan Grove.
    
-   Jeff's [Skinner demo](http://jconniff.github.com/skinner/) and Tilo's initial version of the [Responsive Grid Builder](http://gridbuilder.herokuapp.com/) are both available online.
    
-   [Iliyan Peychev](https://twitter.com/ipeychev), one of our popular community members wrote a [great post about YUIConf](/yuiblog/blog/2012/11/29/yuiconf-2012-two-awesome-days/) from a YUI contributor's perspective.
    
-   The YUI Team hosted it's first [Open Hours roundtable discussion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NjP_ndoO5Q) this **Thursday (November 29th)**. Anyone can join in and participate in these discussions, and they will take place every **Thursday at 2pm PST**. We use Google Hangouts for these sessions, so make sure to add [YUI Library](https://plus.google.com/105600930514903803035/posts) to your circles. The [Github Wiki](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Roundtable-Topics)lists ongoing roundtable topics.
    
-   One of the topics mentioned in the roundtable was the [Contributor Model](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model) and the [Contribution Standards Guidelines](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contribution-Standards). If you're interested in contributing to YUI, you should read over these. We're still looking for feedback so get your voice heard!
    
-   Sebastian Gurin wrote an in-depth article about [using YUI with Google Web Toolkit](http://cancerbero.mbarreneche.com/yuigwt/gallery/?test=uibinderuserguide&%3bsingleTest=1) (GWT). It sounds interesting and is worth a read!
    
-   [Jeff Pihach](https://twitter.com/FromAnEgg) (@fromanegg, @hatch on IRC) wrote an article on [how to add pop-up functionality to YUI widgets](https://github.com/apipkin/yui3/wiki/Popup-Plugin).
