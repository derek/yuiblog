In this talk from the March 5, 2012 [BayJax](http://www.meetup.com/BayJax/) event at Yahoo!, [Douglas Crockford](https://plus.google.com/118095276221607585885/) outlines the basic principles of designing secure software, with a focus on web applications. With his usual sardonic wit, he starts at the beginning (almost literally -- with the invention of language itself) and makes a strong case for designing secure software based on fundamental principles rather than specific techniques, tricks, or hacks.
