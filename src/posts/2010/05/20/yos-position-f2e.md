The Yahoo! Open Strategy (YOS) Team is building the next generation of open platforms. One of our upcoming products - Connect - is targeted at third-party publishers and developers. Connect allows third-parties to easily integrate with Yahoo! by dropping a few lines of Javascript code on their site. Further, Connect enables users to login to third-party websites using their Yahoo! IDs and broadcast their updates to friends and followers.

Connect uses several Yahoo technologies including [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/ "Yahoo! Query Language - YDN") and [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ "YUI Library"). In particular, Connect leverages the core libraries from YUI3 (node, io, custom events) and the widget infrastructure to provide a consistent api and cross-browser experience. Once fully developed, Connect will be deployed across thousands of web-sites and be visible to millions of consumers. This is an exciting opportunity to be involved with a project that will have outstanding consumer reach and challenging scalability requirements.

The ideal candidate will have 5+ years of large-scale web development experience, including familiarity with browser-side client technologies such as Javascript, HTML and CSS and with cross-browser compatibility issues, optimization techniques, and internationalization. Knowledge of PHP and a JavaScript library — such as YUI — are required.
