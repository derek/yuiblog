The only thing that's _not_ awesome about [Yahoo! having an Open Hack Day in Indonesia this weekend](http://openhack2009sea.pbworks.com/) is that it's too far away for many of us in California to make the trip. Fortunately, an excellent group of international Yahoo!s will be carrying the purple flag — and talking about projects ranging from [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/) to [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/).

Angela has been a frontend engineer with Yahoo! for two years, most recently working with Yahoo! 360plus, the blogging product for Vietnam, as well as other offerings such as the iCafe initiative, Mash, and News. Angela will be providing a hacker-oriented introduction to [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/); she's speaking at 11 a.m. on Saturday.

[Contributing a YUI 3 Gallery item](/yuiblog/blog/2009/11/04/introducing-the-yui-3-gallery/) is a great way to impress your hack-day judges...
