Tune in and hang out with Tilo and Eric on **Wednesday, December 12 at 11am PST** as we try to figure out how to tackle some existing event-tap bugs. We'll specifically be looking at [this bug](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2532831) regarding preventing default behavior on 'tap' events.
