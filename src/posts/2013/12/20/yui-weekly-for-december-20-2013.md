As we say goodbye to this year, we have some nice goodies lined up for you. Learn out about our latest releases, and find out what happens when you run YUI inside a Tesla Model S. All this and more, in 2013's last YUI Weekly:

# Release News

This week, we released [YUI 3.14.1](/yuiblog/blog/2013/12/18/yui-3-14-1-released/), which brings support for IE11 and Android 4.4. You can find it on the [CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.14.1/build/yui/yui-min.js) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/yui), or download it as a [zip](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.14.1.zip). Check out the [release post](/yuiblog/blog/2013/12/18/yui-3-14-1-released/) for more details.

There was also a new release of [Yeti](http://yeti.cx). We use Yeti to automate our tests across browsers. In fact, _over 21 million_ tests have been automated with Yeti since July! [Yeti 0.2.25](https://github.com/yui/yeti/releases/tag/v0.2.25) lets you specify Selenium capabilities directly along with some other nice improvements. Get it off [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/yeti) or [view the release post](http://yeti.cx) for more details.

# Open Roundtable

We continued our "YUI in the Wild" series at the [Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiNlE8DOdus) this week. Mayumi joined us and discussed how she uses YUI at her work. It was an interesting conversation and I recommend checking it out.

If you are using YUI and you'd like to show off what you've been building, you can sign up for a spot at our Open Roundtable at [this wiki](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable). Open Roundtable will return on January 9th!

# New This Week

-   What's the first thing that you do when you sit inside a Tesla? Well, I check out the comfortable seats but others run some YUI unit tests. [Find out what happens next](http://www.flickr.com/photos/uberlife/11362128574/) on Reid's Flickr!
-   [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericf) has been working on [a Rework plugin](https://github.com/ericf/rework-pure-grids) that generates CSS for mobile-first responsive grids. Stay tuned for more news related to this in the new year!

# The World of JavaScript

-   Jake Archibald wrote [a great article about Promises](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/) on HTML5Rocks. It's a great place to start for those who are new to Promises and Generators. I got a lot out of it.
-   There's a good discussion over at Hacker News about the [Future of JavaScript MVCs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6936975).
-   Stoyan Stefanov gives his tips on [Writing High Quality JavaScript](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/the-essentials-of-writing-high-quality-javascript/) over at Tuts+.

# Happy Holidays

That's a wrap, folks. From everyone at the YUI Team, we wish you Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year! YUI Weekly will be back in the first week of January. See you all in 2014!
