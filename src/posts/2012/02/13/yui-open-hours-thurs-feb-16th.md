### Yeti update

Reid has freed up some time for Yeti development recently, and there are some worthwhile updates to broadcast in the world of automated JavaScript testing. There have been the standard issue bug fixes and enhancements, of course, but during the hour, we'll talk about some of the more important changes, including:

-   the new iframeless design
-   the new ability to share a testing hub with a team of developers, and
-   how to follow development and when to expect a release
