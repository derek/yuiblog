[![YUI engineer Satyen Desai at YUICONF 2009, held at the Yahoo! HQ in Sunnyvale; October 28, 2009.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/desai-yuiconf2009-widgets-20091103-081339.jpg)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets)

Satyen Desai ([@dezziness](http://twitter.com/dezziness)) leads development of the [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/) [widget infrastructure](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/widget/), a system that is currently in beta and due for its first production-quality release in Q1 2010. At [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/), Satyen provided a deep-dive on this emerging foundation in his session, "[A Widget Walkthrough](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets)." If you're considering the development of YUI 3-based widgets [to share on the new YUI 3 Gallery](/yuiblog/2009/11/04/introducing-the-yui-3-gallery/), or if you simply want to understand more deeply the inner workings of YUI 3 visual components, Satyen's talk is a fantastic place to start. (Note: Satyen [has an earlier YUI Theater session on the YUI 3 architecture](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yui3) that is also a must-see for serious YUI 3 developers.)
