Mark your calendars! We're pleased to announce that YUIConf 2009, Yahoo!'s annual front-end engineering conference, will take place October 28 and 29 on our Sunnyvale campus.

We have a stellar lineup of technical sessions coming together for this year's YUI-themed event, including

-   a sneak peek at the latest and greatest evolutions to the YUI library
-   deep dives into the core components of [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/), such as Node and Event
-   the widget infrastructure
-   internationalization
-   contributing to YUI
-   and much, much more!

For the first time this year we'll be making available a limited number of seats for external developers, so stay tuned for schedule and registration information. Hope to see you there!
