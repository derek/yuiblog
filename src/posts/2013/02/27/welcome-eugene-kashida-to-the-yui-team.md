We are pleased to announce the addition of Eugene Kashida ([@ekashida](https://twitter.com/ekashida)) to the YUI Team! Eugene comes to us from the Yahoo! Axis team. During his time there he helped develop [Axis](http://axis.yahoo.com/), a simple and fast web-based mobile search application. Axis was built upon YUI and Mojito so Eugene brings all of his experience developing this application to our team. He's a fantastic engineer and we look forward to his contributions!

From Eugene:

> "I was fortunate enough to work with an awesome team to launch Axis, one of Yahoo!'s first hybrid applications, and now I get to work with all the talented folks in the YUI/Mojito community! I'm super excited!"
