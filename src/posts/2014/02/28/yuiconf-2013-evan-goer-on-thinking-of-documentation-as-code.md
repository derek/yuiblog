The weather may be keeping you inside this Friday, but that gives you a great opportunity to check out some great YUIConf 2013 videos. Today we feature the talk from [Evan Goer](https://twitter.com/evangoer) following up on his [last year's talk](/yuiblog/blog/2012/12/10/yuiconf-2012-talk-writing-for-developers-some-rational-techniques-by-evan-goer/) on "[Thinking of Documentation as Code](http://youtu.be/mEvvc80ZYU8)". From there, you can watch the [previous video](/yuiblog/blog/2014/02/27/yuiconf-2013-pull-request-a-palooza-with-anthony-pipkin/) or watch all of the available YUIConf talk with our [YouTube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKP9DUCzZorde6sLWHJ3GNd-6VrGrbqm).
