### Component owner updates and a discussion about the future of Loader

In the wake of Adam Moore leaving the YUI team for "Startup"ier pastures, we recently did a big shuffle of components, assigning new owners to a number of core components including Loader, Event, and the YUI global. [Dav Glass](http://twitter.com/davglass) will be cohosting the call with [Eric F](http://twitter.com/ericf) this week to talk about the reassignments and open the conversation about what's on the roadmap for these components.

If you have brilliant ideas, nagging itches, or just plain old thoughts about the YUI global object, Loader, the module system, or anything else, call in. We're all ears!
