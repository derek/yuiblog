_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   This week saw the release of **YUI 3.10**, a release focusing mostly on low-level performance in [Attribute](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/attribute/), [Base](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/base/), and [EventTarget](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/event-custom/). It also includes [Y.Tree](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tree/) improvements, deprecation of [Profiler](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/profiler/), and was also the first GA release built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). For all the details about the release check out the [release announcement](/yuiblog/2013/04/24/yui-3-10-0-released/) as well as the [full comparison](https://github.com/yui/yui3/compare/v3.9.1...v3.10.0) of changes. Take a look at Eric Ferraiuolo's ["YUI 3.10.0 – Go Fast"](https://speakerdeck.com/ericf/yui-3-dot-10-dot-0-go-fast) presentation from the After Hours event earlier this month for specifics on the performance improvements.
    
-   This week’s Open Roundtable ([notes](https://gist.github.com/triptych/5463939), [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyTYhWnoki4)) featured discussions on YUI2's upcoming EOL, an update on the migration to Github Issues for bug tracking, Google Groups for forums, stale pull request reviews, and a [refactor of the YUI seed](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/586).
    
-   Activity on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/yui-contrib) this week included an [announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/jQM0Y5Qsblg) that the project will be replacing the bug tracker and forums, and a [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/yui-contrib/voC7-k2lhIQ) of the [YUI Contributor Model](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model)'s 72-hour window.
