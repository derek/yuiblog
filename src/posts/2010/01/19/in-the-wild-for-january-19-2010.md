-   **[Dan Wellman's YUI Compressor Automator Desktop Application for Windows](http://www.danwellman.co.uk/new-application-yui-compressor-automator/):** Dan Wellman, author of _[Learning the Yahoo User Interface Library](/yuiblog/2008/04/10/wellman-yui-book/)_, has issued a wrapper application for the [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/).  [Writes Dan](http://www.danwellman.co.uk/new-application-yui-compressor-automator/): "My application wraps the YUI Compressor in a visual GUI, shielding you from the command-line scaryness that would otherwise ensue (ok, CLI’s are nice and friendly once you’ve used them a few times, but a lot of non-developers shy away from them). To minify files you just select them in Windows Explorer and drag them into the application window. The application then spits the files out into a folder on your desktop."

-   **[Iain Lamb's Scale, Rhythm, and Typography Exploration Using YUI 2](http://lamb.cc/typograph/):** Writes the always-thoughtful [Iain Lamb](http://lamb.cc/): "This page is both an essay and a tool. It sets out to explore how two, intertwined concepts, often playful but sometimes cheeky, can be encouraged to dance in web pages. Drag the colored boxes along the scale to throw these words anew. For the most part, this text is just a libretto for the performance you are about to play upon it."  Intrigued?  [Check it out here](http://lamb.cc/typograph/).

-   **[Multiple Combo-boxes with YUI and CakePHP](http://grasshopperpebbles.com/ajax/multiple-combo-boxes-with-yui-and-cakephp/):** Les Green is on fire this month with YUI-related blog posts.  This one looks at doing multiple combo-boxes using YUI on the frontend and CakePHP on the backend.  Writes Les: "I’m working on a project where I use YUI and CakePHP to fill multiple combo boxes on a page using Json data. At first, I wrote separate code with the same functionality for each combo box. Every time I needed to change the functionality, I had to change it for each combo box. After doing this multiple times, I decided to combine the functionality on both the front-end (YUI) and the back-end (CakePHP)."  [Check out his full post](http://grasshopperpebbles.com/ajax/multiple-combo-boxes-with-yui-and-cakephp/) for all the details and code samples.
