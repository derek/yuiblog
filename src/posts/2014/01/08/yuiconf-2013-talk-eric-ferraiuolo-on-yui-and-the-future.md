Happy New Year! It's great to kick off 2014 with awesome videos of the YUIConf 2013 presentations. If you recall from [last year](/yuiblog/blog/2012/12/03/yuiconf-2012-talk-anthony-pipkin-on-building-modules-for-the-new-gallery/), we posted a new video every few days or so for you to check out. We are kicking off this series with a great talk from [Eric Ferraiuolo](https://twitter.com/ericf) on "[YUI and the Future](http://youtu.be/0qN3mHH5snc)". Stay tuned! In a few days we'll have another new presentation to share.

(Note: the videos are still in the process of being transcribed, but we did not want to delay releasing them any further. Transcriptions will be added as they are completed.)

Here are [the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/ericf/yui-and-the-future) for this talk.
