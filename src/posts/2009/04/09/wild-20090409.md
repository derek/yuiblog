-   **[Smart Polling from Eric Ferraiuolo, Built for YUI 3](http://925html.com/code/smart-polling/):** Eric Ferraiuolo has launched a [Smart Polling](http://925html.com/code/smart-polling/) component based on the YUI 3 preview release.  Smart Polling is a strategy for checking the server for fresh content.  Here's Eric's description of how it works:  "Internally the Poller class is using conditional XHR GET requests. When polling is first kicked off (i.e. `start()` is called) the **Etag and Last-Modified header values are cached**. As subsequent polling requests are sent to the server the cached **Etag** is set for the **If-None-Match** HTTP request header, if no Etag was cached (i.e. the server doesn’t send Etags) then the cached **Last-Modified** date is set as the **If-Modified-Since** header. If a server doesn’t support conditional GET requests at all, sending neither an Etag nor a Last-Modified date, the Poller class will fire the `modified` event with every response."  Check out his blog post for more details and to grab the source code.

-   **[Les Green, "Scope Correction and YUI"](http://grasshopperpebbles.com/ajax/scope-correction-with-yui/):** [Writes Les](http://grasshopperpebbles.com/ajax/scope-correction-with-yui/): "The more I use the [Yahoo User Interface Library (YUI)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/), the more I am impressed with it. I have been converting my JQuery imValidateForm plugin to a YUI widget for a project that I am working on. I ran into a scope issue when a button was clicked. I have dealt with Javascript scope issues in the past, but I did not know how to fix it using YUI."  [He documents his learnings in a new blog post](http://grasshopperpebbles.com/ajax/scope-correction-with-yui/).

It’s those elements that seem to float on the page like hovering little angels. Ok enough with the sappy crap…down to business. So you need to create a browser independent simple script to position an element on a page. I put together a simple script that will handle such a task and is flexible enough for even a newbie to configure."  Check out [his post](http://www.yuicoder.com/2009/03/creating-a-fixed-element-with-re-size-and-scroll-detection-using-yui-dom-and-event/) for full details.

-   **[Sanjay Ginde's LazyLoadDataSource](http://sanjayginde.squarespace.com/journal/2009/3/25/lazy-load-datasource-for-yui.html):** Sanjay Ginde [published his variation on YUI DataSource's XHRDataSource class](http://sanjayginde.squarespace.com/journal/2009/3/25/lazy-load-datasource-for-yui.html).  Writes Sanjay: "While working on some auto-completing features for a project I realized that there was a remote retrieval mechanism missing. I had small datasets that I wanted to retrieve on demand in a single request. I thought to use the XHRDataSource at first, but there would continue to be multiple requests with each letter I typed.  To solve my requirement for a lazy, single-request data source, I created the (obviously named) LazyLoadDataSource. It's much like the XHRDataSource, except it expects to retrieve all the data in a single request. Now I can create more efficient auto-completes that can retrieve data on demand while keeping requests to the server at an absolute minimum."  The core use case here is that you have a small dataset, but you don't want to load that data into the page until it's needed; however, the dataset is small enough that, once it's needed, you want to load it all at once.
