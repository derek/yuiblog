_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community._

## Release News

### Pure

The Pure team released [Pure 0.5.0 Release Candidate 1](https://github.com/yui/pure/releases/tag/v0.5.0-rc-1) this week. This RC includes a complete overhaul of Pure's current Grid system, and replaces it with a new mobile-first responsive grid.

There have also been new additions to the [Pure Website](http://stage.purecss.io), including a brand new [Getting Started](http://stage.purecss.io/start/) page and new [Grids Documentation](http://stage.purecss.io/grids/). Since this is an RC release, you can find the new changes over on the [staging website](http://stage.purecss.io).

Let us know what you think of the new changes! We'll squash any remaining bugs and release Pure 0.5.0 shortly.

## YUI Open Roundtable

This week's [YUI Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrqVlLeOl-I) featured discussions with [Seth Bertalotto](https://twitter.com/redonkulus), [Eric Ferraiuolo](https://twitter.com/ericf) and [yours truly](https://twitter.com/tilomitra). Seth showed off how Yahoo uses custom [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generators to create modules, while Eric and I discussed the [latest Pure release](http://github.com/yui/pure/releases).

## The World of JavaScript

Here are some good articles to get you up-to-speed on what's been happening in the world of JavaScript this week.

-   Chris Sevilleja [wrote a post](http://scotch.io/bar-talk/expressjs-4-0-new-features-and-upgrading-from-3-0) explaining the upcoming changes in [Express](http://expressjs.com) 4.0.
-   Tagtree has started [a video series on ES6](http://tagtree.tv/ecmascript-6-episode-1). The first video is out and it covers arrow functions, string templating and destructuring assignments. I like these videos since they are short and easily consumable.
-   The folks over at [Segment.io](http://segment.io) released [MetalSmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), an extremely simple, pluggable static site generator. I'm looking forward to checking this out.

That's all for this week. Catch you in 7 days!
