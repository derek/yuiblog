_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   After last week's batch of releases for [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com), [Yeti](http://yeti.cx/), and [Pure](http://purecss.io/), the team has begun working towards the next cycle of releases. Announced this week was the [Sprint 9 development schedule](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#sprint-9-next-release), which began on July 23rd and concludes with a stable release on August 27th. The next milestone for this sprint is the Aug 11th [code freeze](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contribution-Standards#code-freeze) pull request deadline. So for anyone working towards backwards incompatible updates, that is your deadline to submit a pull request.
    
-   Recently Github announced [Releases](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software), a place for projects to host information and downloads for releases. You can now find all current and future release information for YUI at [github.com/yui/yui3/releases](https://github.com/yui/yui3/releases) ([atom feed](https://github.com/yui/yui3/releases.atom)).
    
-   At this week’s [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable), discussion topics included the recently released [Paginator](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/paginator/) component, a [Perf test refresh proposal](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1029), a demo of [@rashadrussell](https://github.com/rashadrussell)'s Pure Layout Generator project, and a discussion on Github's [default branches](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch). You can find a video of that Hangout [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTA3fQYdOHE) or view it below.

-   For anyone interested in [DataTable](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/datatable/) development, just a reminder that there is a [DataTable Trello Roadmap board](https://trello.com/b/fTpWY4oN/datatable-roadmap) where you can track development and suggest enhancements.
    
-   In devtool news, [Shifter](https://github.com/yui/shifter/) received a version bump this week from [v0.4.1 to v0.4.2](https://github.com/yui/shifter/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2), and [Yogi](https://github.com/yui/yogi/) from [v0.1.10 to v0.1.11](https://github.com/yui/yogi/compare/v0.1.10...master). Upgrade with `npm install -g shifter yogi`.
