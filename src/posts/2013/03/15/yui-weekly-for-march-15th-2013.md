_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, leave a comment below._

-   As you've probably seen, **3.9.0 is out**! Thanks for your patience while we double-triple checked everything was stable for this feature-filled release. We've compiled [a blog post](/yuiblog/blog/2013/03/13/announcing-yui-3-9-0/) containing all the goodies included in this release. FYI, the next release window is tentatively scheduled for April 16th, but we'll let you know when something is formalized and posted on our [Development Schedule wiki](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule#wiki-next-release).

Check it out @ [Windows 8 Loves YUI](/yuiblog/blog/2013/03/12/windows-8-loves-yui/).
