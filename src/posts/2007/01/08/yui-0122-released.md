Version 0.12.2 of [the Yahoo User Interface Library (YUI)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) was released this morning. This minor update focuses on bugs and issues raised since 0.12.1; no new features are introduced in this release.

Among the improvements you'll notice in 0.12.2 include:

-   In the [Animation Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/), we've improved the consistency of the duration of animations between browsers; specifically, animations in Safari should now last the full specified duration.
-   The [Container family](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/) of controls has benefitted from [several bug fixes](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/build/container/README).
-   In 0.12.1, we introduced some errors in the examples provided in the distribution; those have been corrected, and examples in the distribution should now work identically to those on [the YUI website](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/).
