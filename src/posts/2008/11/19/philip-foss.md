In a little over a week from now, I'll be speaking at the [FOSS.IN](http://foss.in/) conference in Bangalore. FOSS.IN is an annual conference in India with the aim of creating more FOSS contributors, in particular from India. My talk will cover what it takes to [contribute to YUI](http://foss.in/2008/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=646).

If you happen to be in Bangalore between November 25 and 29, drop in to the conference. You can [register online](http://foss.in/register/delegate-registration) to get 50% off on the conference fee.

Hope to see some of you there.
