_Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community. If you have any interesting demos or links you’d like to share, feel free to leave a comment below._

-   Just two weeks to [YUIConf](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/)! Thanks to everyone who submitted feedback on [last week's survey](/yuiblog/blog/2013/10/17/yuiconf-technical-sessions-and-survey/) which has been helpful to optimize the session schedule and reduce conflicts. If you haven't had a chance to submit your feedback yet, please take a few minutes to do so. Also, to help YUIConf speakers practice and [give great tech talks](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/speakers/), we ask that they give at least one practice session in front of a live audience. If you'd like to sit in on any of these practice sessions, please sign-up on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PtVGYEOhFrFFstOQH0DPdCyvSgzwoQsVcjK6EN_FInE/edit).
    
-   A reminder that there will be two full-day workshops the day before YUIConf, _"YUI Introduction"_ for beginners, and _"YUI Building Blocks"_ for more advanced developers. You can RSVP for either of those sessions [here](http://yuiconf2013-workshops.eventbrite.com/).
    
-   At this week’s [Open Roundtable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable), discussion topics focused on [Pure](http://purecss.io/), specifically integration with Bower/Grunt/Yeoman, preprocessors, configuration & customization, additional layouts, and more. You can find a video of that Hangout [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJkLRRLFrks).
    
-   Discussion this week on the [contributor mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/yui-contrib) focused on [importing Pure Base and Grids into YUI](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/yui-contrib/20MGVD2J3GM) and its [associated pull request](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1240).
    
-   [AWS S3 ImageManager](https://github.com/GlitterCakes/Aws-S3-ImageManager) is a YUI-based app that uses a responsive design grid layout to display images in an S3 bucket. You can check out a demo [here](http://im.trepe.net).
    
-   Version bumps this week for the following YUI devtools: [Grover](https://github.com/yui/grover/) and [YUI Doc](https://github.com/yui/yuidoc). Upgrade with `npm install -g grover yuidocjs`.
    
-   Updated modules in this week’s [Gallery build](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/buildtag/gallery-2013.10.24-18-05) include: [datetime-utils](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datetime-utils) and [datasource-async-function](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/datasource-async-function).
