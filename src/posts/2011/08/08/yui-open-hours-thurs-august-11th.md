### Search Direct Accessibility

We're going to follow up on the previous [post about Search Direct](/yuiblog/2011/08/08/making-search-direct-accessible/). There's a lot about Search Direct worth talking about, but for starters, the experience of getting the accessibility right is both interesting and important. [Victor Tsaran](http://twitter.com/vick08) and [Caridy Patiño](http://twitter.com/caridy) will join us on the call to talk about the project, review the implementation details, and answer any questions you have about Search Direct or accessibility best practices.

### Time & Details

~We're changing the format this week. We're going to try to host the session entirely on Adobe Connect. There will be _no conference bridge_ to dial into. The audio will also be through Connect. We'll use the Connect chat to manage questions.~

We'll be online as usual from **10am to 11am PDT Thursday** in [the Open Hours Connect room](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/).

### Update: We'll still be on the conference bridge

In a stroke of irony, it turns out that Connect does not have good accessibility for blind participants, so we'll be using Connect for screen sharing and the conference bridge for audio as usual. The connection details are:

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (Skype works great for non-US participants\*)
2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953#
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

### Update #2: Recording available
