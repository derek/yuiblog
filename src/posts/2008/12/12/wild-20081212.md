This will be our last "In the Wild" post for 2008. It's been a fun year, filled with a lot of exciting implementations and other developments in the YUI world. Here are the once we've noted lately:

-   **[YUI Sightings — PulpTunes](http://www.pulptunes.com):** Here's the elevator pitch for [PulpTunes](http://www.pulptunes.com/): "You’ve got a huge music collection in your iTunes at home.  You want to access that music from the office, at a friend’s party, or let other people hear it from anywhere in the world.  Install PulpTunes and access your music from anywhere, through a web browser."  [Check out the demo](http://www.pulptunes.com/demo) (filled with Creative Commons-licensed tunes) and see what a fantastic job Alejandro Pedraza has done in making a web-based jukebox app powered by a variety of YUI components.

-   **[Visual Event for YUI and JQuery](http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event):** Visual Event is the brainchild of Allan Jardine.  [Here's how he describes it](http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event): "When working with events in Javascript, it is often easy to loose track of what events are subscribed where. This is particularly true if you are using a large number of events, which is typical in a modern interface employing progressive enhancement. Javascript libraries also add another degree of complexity to listeners from a technical point of view, while from a developers point of view they of course can make life much easier! But when things go wrong it can be difficult to trace down why this might be.  It is due to this I've put together a Javascript bookmarklet called [Visual Event](http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event) which visually shows the elements on a page that have events subscribed to them, what those events are and the function that the event would run when triggered. This is primarily intended to assist debugging, but it can also be very interesting and informative to see the subscribed events on other pages."  Visual Event supports jQuery and YUI (version 2.6.0 has been tested, but others work as well).

-   **[YUI Sighting — G-Snap!](http://www.gsnap.com/):** G-Snap is a new service that let's you tap into ad-hoc communities that form around real-time events -- say, an NFL game or a political rally.  Events are called snapcasts, and you can join them or create them on the fly, from your desktop or by phone.  The snapcast UI relies heavily on YUI, incorporating most of the utility foundation and several widgets.

-   **[Music Startup Bandcamp Using YUI](http://bandcamp.mu/):** Oddpost co-founder Ethan Diamond has created Bandcamp as a means of providing bands with a means of distributing and promoting their music.
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/iridescence-20081203-114146.jpg)](http://iridescence.no/post/JavaScript-is-Code-Too-Test-It%21.aspx)**[A Review of (and Tutorial For) YUITest](http://iridescence.no/post/JavaScript-is-Code-Too-Test-It%21.aspx):** Fredrik Kalseth recently published on his blog an entry titled [JavaScript is Code Too: Test It!](http://iridescence.no/post/JavaScript-is-Code-Too-Test-It%21.aspx). It's well worth a read. After quickly summarizing why unit testing is important he walks through the steps necessary to create a unit test for a simple edit-in-place behavior. (Note that his edit-in-place code is written in jQuery; YUITest will test any type of JavaScript - the JS to be tested need not be written using YUI.) He concludes with his overall impressions of [YUITest](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/). Full source code for his demo test is available for download.
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiaspnet-20081209-153745.png)](http://www.yuiasp.net/free-aspnet-controls/ControlList/detail.aspx)**[New YUI Controls Added at YUIAsp.Net](http://www.yuiasp.net/free-aspnet-controls/ControlList/detail.aspx):** The [YUIAsp.Net](http://www.yuiasp.net/) project has released another batch of YUI controls into the mix.  It now supports: AutoComplete, Button, Calendar, Charts, ColorPicker, DataTable, Editor, Logger, Menu, Paginator, Slider, TabView, and TreeView.  It's now easier than ever to use YUI in your .Net projects.
-   **[YUI Sightings — WishAHome.com, Indian Real Estate Site](http://www.wishahome.com/):** [WishAHome.com](http://www.wishahome.com/) is a real estate portal, according to its authors, that targets "Indian users \[and\] that tries to provide property listings in a unique and innovative way. The information provided by the site is to-the-point and extra care has been taken to ensure that the information posted by users is accurate."  The site makes extensive use of YUI, including a nicely-skinned implementation of Matt Sweeney's [YUI TabView Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/) on the home page.

-   **[Creating a TextBox Calendar with YUI](http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/rymoore/creating-a-textbox-calendar-with-yui-28431):** Ryan Moore of Toolbox.com has been exploring YUI, and he's posted one of the fruits of his early exploration -- an adaptation of the [YUI Calendar Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/).  [Writes Ryan](http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/rymoore/creating-a-textbox-calendar-with-yui-28431): "This class is based on [code posted by DavGlass](http://blog.davglass.com/files/yui/cal2/), which was for YUI .12 - it allows you to pop up a YUI Calendar Control when you click on a text box, and then populate the text box with the calendar's value when a date is selected."
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/ariatheatre-20081209-131151.jpg)](http://codetalks.org/video/)**[Todd Kloots on CodeTalks ARIA Theatre](http://codetalks.org/video/):** The fantastic [CodeTalks](http://codetalks.org) site, dedicated to web accessibility, has an [ARIA Theatre](http://codetalks.org/video/) section to which [YUI accessibility specialist Todd Kloots's recent video](/yuiblog/2008/12/08/video-kloots-aria/) has been added.  This video archive should become a valuable resource for front-end engineers as it aggregates tech talks on the art and science of building accessible web applications.
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/bluegriffon-20081209-162245.png)](http://bluegriffon.org/)**[BlueGriffon Adds Support for YUI CSS Grids-based Layouts](http://bluegriffon.org/):** Daniel Glazman from the [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/) project has added support for [Nate Koechley](http://nate.koechley.com/)'s [YUI CSS Grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/).  BlueGriffon is a web page editor based on the Gecko rendering engine that powers Firefox.
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuitextarea-20081204-181255.jpg)](http://www.lutsr.nl/yui/textarea/)**[Text Area Character Throttle](http://www.lutsr.nl/yui/textarea/):** Some people (I'm not naming names, although "Miraglia" is a long name) tend to run on and on if you give them an open text field, so it's sometimes necessary to throttle their otherwise undisciplined input in hopes that they'll remove redundant, repetitive adjectives before submitting your form.  Lustr.nl has a YUI-based solution for you with its textarea character throttle.
-   **[YUI in DreamWeaver CS4](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/42042):** YUI founder Thomas Sha has been working with Adobe to improve YUI support in the new DreamWeaver CS4.  He'll have more to say about this soon on the blog, but the question came up in the forums and we wanted to point you to Thomas's response.  If you're already using CS4, [check out Thomas's notes on how to get started with the new YUI extensions](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/42042).
-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/montagraph-20081211-102037.png)](http://www.montagraph.com/Views/PhotoMontage.aspx?photoID=12913)**[YUI Sightings — Montagraph](http://www.montagraph.com/Views/PhotoMontage.aspx?photoID=12913):** Montagraph is a fun site that allows you to create photo montages quickly from existing templates or to create your own template for sharing with others.  A number of YUI components, including Dav Glass's [ImageCropper Control](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imagecropper/), are in use on the site.
