The next installment of YUI: Open Hours will be this Wednesday, the 15th.

[Dav Glass](http://twitter.com/davglass) will be joining us again to give us some updates on the exciting stuff he's been working on lately. Specifically, he wants to share his progress in making YUI 3 the best JavaScript library to use in a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) environment (that's server side JS for the unintroduced, [and it's hot](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-loopage)). Besides the typical boat load of inspiration and awe Dav is always good for, he'll also be _your_ captive audience for the duration, so if you have questions for him or want to open a YUI 3 discussion in any of his areas of expertise (it's hard to guess wrong here), don't miss this opportunity.

We'll be online from 10am to 12pm PDT. The connection details are the same as usual.

1.  Dial in to 1-888-371-8922 (Skype works great for non-US participants\*)
2.  Enter the attendee code 47188953#
3.  [Join the screen sharing session](https://www.meeting.corp.yahoo.com/r82701271/) (this will prompt you to install the Adobe Connect plugin if this is your first time using it)

And finally, the yuilibrary.com forum thread for this Open Hours is [here](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=4889). Look there for notes, interesting takeaways, and the recording of the call after it's done. Or start the conversation off early by posting questions, suggestions for topics, or code that you'd like review.

Don't forget to subscribe to the [YUI Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/calendar/#calendar) and follow [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) on Twitter for the latest updates on Open Hours and other YUI interestingness.

Hope to see you there!
