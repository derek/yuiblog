-   [![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/searchsitestoyan-20090221-092126.jpg)](http://www.phpied.com/search-site-bookmarklet-with-yui-and-boss/)**[Stoyan Stefanov's Site Search Bookmarklet with YUI and BOSS](http://www.phpied.com/search-site-bookmarklet-with-yui-and-boss/):** Stoyan [has created a bookmarklet](http://www.phpied.com/search-site-bookmarklet-with-yui-and-boss/) that generates a YUI and [BOSS](http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/)\-powered search box for your site (or any collection of sites).  Writes Stoyan: "Ever wanted to search only the web site you're currently on? Not the page, but the whole site. And only this site, not the rest of the web. This bookmarklet does just that."  Using the excellent BOSS engine ("build your own search service") from Yahoo! Search, along with YUI components like Adam Moore's [Get Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/), Stoyan provides a nice addition for any site, with the [code available on GitHub](http://github.com/stoyan/etc/tree/master). He's even provided a screencast to get you started:

-   **[Exponent CMS 0.97 GA Arrives with Tighter YUI Integration](http://www.exponentcms.org/):** From the Exponent CMS blog post [regarding the 0.97 GA release](http://www.exponentcms.org/index.php?module=newsmodule&action=view&id=70&src=%40random444fe03276195): "Many components now take advantage of YUI's JS and CSS framework, including Navigation Management, News, Calendar, Image Gallery, Navigation Module Views, and the administrative chrome. A very tight integration with [YUI Loader](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/) also provides a great framework for YUI Developers to quickly get scripts up and going, letting Exponent and YUI handle the work of figuring out dependencies."

-   **[On-demand Loading for the YUI RTE in Drupal from @xhochy](http://xhochy.org/en/2009/02/28/yui-rich-text-editor-with-on-demand-loading-in-drupal/):** Writes XhochY: "I love the YUI Rich Text Editor as a Drupal module as it is simply configurable and all my users are doing well with it but there has still been the problem \[in\] that the CSS and JavaScript files that it used have been loaded on any Drupal page, even if there was no textarea for which the editor could have been activated. Since this was now really annoying as my projects got bigger and bigger, I just started an effort to change this! Based on the YUI module 6.x-1.1-rc1 and YUI Rich Text Editor 6.x-2.33, I've made \[a\] patched version which only loads those files if they are needed."
