-   **[Matt Snider, "Augmenting YUI 3 Module Objects"](http://www.mattsnider.com/javascript/augmenting-yui3-module-objects/):** [Writes Matt](http://www.mattsnider.com/javascript/augmenting-yui3-module-objects/): "To start, think about your application. Ask yourself, if you include a common set of YUI 3 modules on every page, or if each page uses a disparate set. If you include the same modules files on every page, then you can consolidate your augmentation into a single file (yui3-ext.js), otherwise, you may want to have a file for the augmentation of each module (yui3-node.ext.js, yui3-widget-ext.js, etc.). When you want to apply your augmented objects, the location of the code needs to be defined in YUI() function."  [Click here for the full article](http://www.mattsnider.com/javascript/augmenting-yui3-module-objects/).

Specifically, we’ll be working with the [YUI TreeView](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/) component, which is a way of presenting a dynamic hierarchical tree in the browser. But we’ll also be looking into [YUI’s Ajax helpers](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/), as we’ll be fleshing out the limbs of the tree dynamically with Ajax calls."  [Check out the full article here](http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/yui-treeview-ajax).
