### YUI/Firebug Engineer: Job Description

-   **Position:** Technical Yahoo!/Senior Front-End Engineer
-   **Location:** Sunnyvale, CA

The Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) team is looking for an engineer to work on the open-source Firebug extension for Firefox (http://getfirebug.com). This developer will work closely with Firebug's creator, Joe Hewitt, as well as with senior engineers on the YUI team to continue Firebug's evolution as the premier open-source debugging and analysis tool. Firebug is largely written in JavaScript and CSS, so a strong background in frontend engineering is required. Moreover, experience designing and creating APIs enabling modular extensibility will be a requirement in the next phase of Firebug's development. Because Firebug is closely tied to Mozilla software, the ability to work productively with the Mozilla community (both as a developer and API consumer) is important.

#### Minimum Job Qualifications:

-   You must have a strong command of X/HTML, DOM, CSS, JavaScript, cross-browser compatibility issues, and client-side performance optimization.
-   You must have a strong command of client/server programming in HTTP environments, including a strong working knowledge of the HTTP protocol.
-   You must have a successful track record of creating and documenting APIs that enable modular, performant extensibility.
-   You must have superior writing and public-speaking skills.
-   You must have a strong attention to detail.
-   Computer Science degree or equivalent work experience required.

#### Preferable Job Qualifications:

-   You should have 5+ years of frontend engineering experience building web-enabled functionality beyond the traditional web-page -- e.g., XUL applications, browser extensions, Greasemonkey widgets, etc.
-   Experience contributing to Mozilla or other open-source projects is highly desired.
-   Experience with C/C++ is highly desired.
-   Familiarity with YUI, Dojo, JQuery and other JavaScript/CSS libraries is a plus.
-   Experience with Javascript/XML-based widget engines is a plus.
