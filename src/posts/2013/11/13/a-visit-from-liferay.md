Last week, the day after [YUIConf 2013](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/2013/), some of the folks from [Liferay](http://www.liferay.com/) ( makers of [AlloyUI](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/alloy-ui/overview) ) came to pay us a visit at the Yahoo offices. New team member [Juan Dopazo](https://twitter.com/juandopazo) showed [Bruno Farache](http://www.liferay.com/web/bruno.farache), [Eduardo Lundgren](http://www.liferay.com/web/eduardo.lundgren) , and [Zeno Rocha](http://www.liferay.com/web/zeno.rocha/) around our offices and chatted with the team. We had a great time and managed to get a snapshot of their visit. Click the image below for a larger version.

Bruno, Eduardo, Zeno, and Juan!

Thanks again to everyone who came to YUIConf this year and thanks to the Liferay team for stopping by!
