We may be in the midst of the NBA finals, but In the Wild leads off this week with [an item](#yuiBlogWild-478) that gets us thinking about August. And football, in turn, gets us thinking about marriage, and in particular about [the first known use of YUI in a marriage proposal](#yuiBlogWild-470). Let us know in the comments [or on Twitter](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary) if we missed anything important.

-   **[Matt Snider's Mac-style Radio Button Preferences As a YUI 3 Module](http://www.mattsnider.com/):** Writes Matt: "One of my favorite UI features of the Mac OS, both OSX and the iPhone, is the way it handles radio inputs. Instead of having small, hard to click little round circle (like the web), there are large buttons that are obviously grouped by use of a connecting bar. The best place to see this is in the system preferences on OSX. [Today's article](http://www.mattsnider.com/), introduces a widget that will do the same, by converting existing radio buttons into a Mac Preference Radio."

YUI Library to build the site as well. The site makes use of the following YUI components: CSS Reset, CSS Fonts, CSS Grids, Yahoo Global Object, DOM Collection, \[and\] Event Utility.  YUI really helped us to work faster and knowing that their library is used and tested by Yahoo! for A-Grade Browser support is a real time saver."

Perhaps the biggest request I have heard is, “How can I use these charts on my secure intranet?” Since Google Apps is an image that is shipped back to you after sending the required data and since SSL is not an option, Google Apps are useless for lists that use secure and sensitive data...  A recent comment on my blog suggested I look at...YUI as a possible solution. After a few hours work, I was able to marry a YUI pie chart with the JQuerry SharePoint List parser and create a Pie Chart generated by your SharePoint List, that does NOT send you data outside the network.'  [Check out his post for full details](http://www.endusersharepoint.com/2010/05/24/secure-pie-charts-for-sharepoint/).
-   **[Integrating YUI with Wicket](http://www.hammersoft.de/blog/?p=31):** Mo Hammer [has written up a tutorial](http://www.hammersoft.de/blog/?p=31) on using the [YUI Rich Text Editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor) with Wicket: "I was searching for a good rich-text editor for a Wicket project for some time, and eventually decided to use the [YUI editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/). It looks fairly nice, and can be configured quite well. Here, I'll demonstrate how to use it with an HTML code editing button, as described in [this example](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/editor/code_editor.html)."
