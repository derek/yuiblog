As the holidays grow near we continue to send you gifts in the form of [video releases](/yuiblog/2012/12/17/yuiconf-2012-talk-mjata-js-bring-data-models-to-life-by-lingyan-zhu/) of [YUIConf 2012](yuilibrary.com/yuiconf). If you are interested in learning more about [ScrollView](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/scrollview/), you'll definitely want to check this talk from [Derek Gathright](http://lanyrd.com/profile/derek/). As always, keep up to speed on all the videos in this series on [YUI Theater](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/) and our new [playlist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByU2zn9DmAA&list=PLjKP9DUCzZooMmiSJ_nmsLIReOZp0Uomz) on YouTube.

In this YUIConf 2012 presentation, Derek Gathright, an engineer on YUI Team, talks about the ScrollView module, and discusses its overall concept, purpose, and use-cases, diving into various implementations and reviewing interested code snippets (gesture events, 3D), and concludes with some tips and "gotchas" along with a roadmap for where the ScrollView development is headed.
