### Mojito

A few weeks ago we took a look at how Y! Axis is built using [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/) and [Mojito](http://developer.yahoo.com/cocktails/mojito/). Axis is a pretty advanced application, so for this Open Hours we wanted to show how to get started with Mojito by creating a more basic application.

[Fabian Frank](https://twitter.com/Fabian_Frank) and [Diego Ferreiro](https://twitter.com/diervo) will be joining us to show how to create a basic Mojito application. Specifically they'll be showing us how to:

-   Call multiple backend services.
-   Rendering a mobile-specific and desktop-specific view, while sharing model and controller logic.
-   Introduction to the Mojit Proxy, and how to seamlessly make client to server RPC calls.
-   Using Mojito's view renderer to render a view on either the client or server.

If you want to learn how to get started with Mojito, please join us!
