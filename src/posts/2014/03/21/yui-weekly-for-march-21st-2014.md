## YUI Open Roundtable

In his week's [YUI Open Roundtable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiNt_XMGrwA), [Clarence](https://twitter.com/clarler), [Jerry](https://twitter.com/jetfault) and [Andrew](twitter.com/triptych) sat down with Lauren Tsung from Yahoo. Lauren has a CS background but is currently a Design Prototyper at Yahoo who focuses on User Experience.

## Tech Talks

Oh boy, oh boy! We released a bunch of tech talks this week that I'm excited to share with you guys!

### Server-side rendering for single-page web apps

Our very own [Clarence Leung](https://twitter.com/clarler) recently gave a lightning talk on [Server-rendering Single Page Applications for Every Framework](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyyH0nfg7I) at [BayNode](http://www.meetup.com/BayNode/). It's a great talk that explains how to use some of the npm components that we've been working on in Modown in your web apps today to make them even more awesome.
