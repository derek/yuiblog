YUI 3.6.0 PR4 is now available to the developer community for feedback and testing on the Yahoo! CDN. Please take a minute to check it out via [CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.6.0pr4/build/yui/yui-min.js) or [download](http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.6.0pr4.zip).

The target date for the stable release of 3.6.0 is July 31, 2012.

You can check out the list of [issues addressed in 3.6.0 PR4](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/133) in our bug tracker. Additionally, you can take a look at the current [change history rollup](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/YUI-3.6.0PR4-Change-History-Rollup) for all components in the library.

PR4 also contains a couple of new modules: the [ModelSync.REST extension](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/model/#restful-xhr), transitioning from its previous home in the Gallery, and the [LazyModelList class](http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/model-list/#lazymodellist).

We invite you to join the [ongoing development discussions](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Ongoing-Development-Discussions) happening with the team over on GitHub.
