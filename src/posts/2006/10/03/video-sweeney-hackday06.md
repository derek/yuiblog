[YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) developer Matt Sweeney gave one of the featured talks at last week's [Developer Day sessions](/yuiblog/blog/2006/09/22/yahoo-devday-schedule/) leading into [Hack Day](http://hackday.org/). Matt, who has authored the YUI's [Animation Utility](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/) and most of the [Dom Collection](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/), is one of the lead CSS architects at Yahoo! and has been at the forefront of conversation in our frontend engineering community with respect to standards. His Developer Day talk, "Web 2.0: Getting It Right the Second Time," articulates the philosophy of frontend architecture he has promoted here for many years.
