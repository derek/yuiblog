[Yahoo! Sports](http://sports.yahoo.com) has reached 36 million unique visitors per month and dominates the Online Sports and Fantasy Sports industry worldwide. The site's recipe for success: high quality content presented via rich and standard-compliant interfaces.

The Y! Sports experience is so engaging, users view over 2 billion pages per month — more than Fox, SI, and CBS Sports combined! To meet such high demands, Y! Sports stays at the forefront of Internet technologies by leveraging platforms such as [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/).

If you consider yourself an avid [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) user, the kind that can look under a component's hood and start adding quality features, you're well on your way to joining their team.
