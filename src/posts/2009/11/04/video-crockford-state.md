[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2519/4058113997_5b044dce9a_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/equanimity/4058113997/)Yahoo!'s JavaScript architect Douglas Crockford gave the closing keynote at [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/) last week. His talk, "[The State and Future of ECMAScript](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-yuiconf2009-state)," was a detailed take on [the events that Brendan Eich discussed the night before](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=eich-yuiconf2009-harmony). Douglas addresses the current ECMAScript 5 proposals (coming up for vote at ECMA in December), details some of the remaining sticking points, and then goes on to distill some of the lessons learned in the course of the ECMA 4/3.1/5 process and what they tell us about the process of creating standards. As Brendan did the night before, Douglas looks ahead to the version of ECMAScript that will follow the current proposal.

Where Brendan [compared the recent ECMA journey to Peter Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings_](http://www.flickr.com/photos/equanimity/4055151876/in/set-72157622684659298/) (specifically, the fellowship of the ring), Douglas turns to Sidney Lumet's _12 Angry Men_ for his metaphor. If you're keeping track, Douglas is Gandalf in the first analogy and Peter Fonda in the second; Brendan is Frodo in the first and Juror #3 in the second.
