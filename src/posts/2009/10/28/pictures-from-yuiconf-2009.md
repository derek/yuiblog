Here are [some pictures coming in on Flickr from YUICONF2009](http://www.flickr.com/search/show/?q=yuiconf2009) on a day that concluded with the father of JavaScript, Brendan Eich, talking about the future of the language:

This was a day that started with a kickoff from YUI project founder Thomas Sha and ended with Brendan Eich. In between were technical explorations by Matt Sweeney, YUI architect, as well as YUI Engineers Luke Smith, Satyen Desai, and Todd Kloots. Other Yahoo's (Jonathan LeBlanc, Reid Burke) gave excellent talks, as did Matt Snider of Mint.com. And, with Brendan's keynote coming at the end of the day, perhaps [YUIer Isaac Schlueter (@izs) summed it up best this way](http://twitter.com/izs/status/5249227498):[![](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/izs-eich.png)](http://twitter.com/izs/status/5249227498)
