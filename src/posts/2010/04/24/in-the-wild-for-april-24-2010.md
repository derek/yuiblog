After [another nice edition of YUI: Open Hours on Friday](/yuiblog/blog/2010/04/22/yui-open-hours-for-friday-april-23rd/), we'll round out this week with just a few notes recent notes and implementations from the YUI development community:

-   **[YUI 2 on Discovery.com](http://dsc.discovery.com/):** Discovery Channel's media-rich site makes use of YUI 2.8.0 Animation and Connection Manager, among other components.

-   **[YUI 3/Node.js Work Reviewed by @dalmaer: "Oh, and YUI 3 is Looking Really Nice These Days"](http://ajaxian.com/archives/server-side-rendering-with-yui-on-node-js):** Dion Almaer takes a look at Dav Glass's YUI 3/Node.js work in Ajaxian.  Write's Dion: "Oh, and YUI3 is looking really nice these days. A nice balance between a nice API + really nice looking widgets + a Crockford's-worth of security care."

-   **[YUI 2 on RealCyclist.com](http://www.realcyclist.com/roadbike/2010-Completes-Bikes-Frames/8497/promo.html?CMP_ID=odat_bt_hptxt_1000060&mv_pc=r1012#app=discount%7E+group%7E100000447+promo%7E8497+brand%7E+sortby%7E+cat%7E+subcat%7E+offset%7E+on_sale%7E+page_name%7E):** At my age, when the road gets steep you start looking for a lighter bike.  (Eating less may be less expensive, but it's less fun.) And if you look on [RealCyclist.com](http://www.realcyclist.com/roadbike/2010-Completes-Bikes-Frames/8497/promo.html?CMP_ID=odat_bt_hptxt_1000060&mv_pc=r1012#app=discount%7E+group%7E100000447+promo%7E8497+brand%7E+sortby%7E+cat%7E+subcat%7E+offset%7E+on_sale%7E+page_name%7E), you can shop on a site powered by a wide range of [YUI 2](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/2/) components.  On a related topic, [BonkTown](http://www.bonktown.com/) -- a bargain site for cyclists -- is also YUI-powered, and you can pick up items like shoe covers that make your feet more aerodynamic in a time trial.

How much did we miss? Let us know via [@yuilibrary](http://twitter.com/yuilibrary/) or in the comments below (if you're feeling retro).

**Stay tuned:** Rey Bango from Ajaxian [stopped by Yahoo yesterday](http://www.flickr.com/photos/equanimity/4547084774/) and recorded a video interview with YUI engineers Luke Smith, Satyen Desai and Adam Moore. That session, plus a talk with BayJax event organizer Gonzalo Cordero, should be running on Ajaxian in the coming week.
