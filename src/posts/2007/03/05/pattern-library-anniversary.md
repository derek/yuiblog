We recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the open-source release of the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/). It is also the one-year anniversary of the public release of the [Yahoo! Design Pattern Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/). Not wanting to miss out on the fun, we published two new patterns: [Calendar Picker](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=calendar) and [Alphanumeric Filter Links](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=alphafilterlinks).

This is also a good opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Christian Crumlish. I am an information architect, interaction designer, writer, and the new curator of the Pattern Library. I think of myself as a pattern _detective_ because a big part of my job is to uncover successful patterns on the Yahoo! network and "in the wild" and capture and document them for eventual publication in the Pattern Library.

I've got some big shoes to fill. Matt Leacock was our first pattern librarian, launched our internal pattern library, developed many of the earliest patterns, and established a structure and process for the library. Bill Scott oversaw the public release of the pattern library as you you probably remember from his posts on this blog and the slew of fantastic Ajax patterns (among others) that he shepherded into the library. Fortunately they're both still nearby for me to hassle when I'm not sure what to do, as is Erin Malone whose leadership has driven the development and release of the library all along.

### The two newest patterns

The [Calendar Picker](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=calendar) comes in handy when users need to select dates or date ranges. Probably the canonical scenario is travel planning. Airline reservation systems all use some variation on the calendar picker pattern and the best ones do a good job of anticipating the date vicinity, especially for the return portion of a round trip. The YUI Library has a [Calendar](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/) control which this pattern complements.

[Alphanumeric Filter Links](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=alphafilterlinks) sound deceptively simple: a common segmentation of large information repositories for easier navigation. (Of course this only works in alphabetic languages!) However, our internal review process uncovered a number of gotchas related to alphabetization and found a number of variations of this pattern to address distinct scenarios. Basic list filtering driven by text-links is so "Web 1.0" so we'll be sure to relate this context to Auto Complete and other dynamic ways of sorting and filtering long lists of data. As we build up the Pattern Library we'll group them together under an umbrella parent pattern.

As always, we welcome discussion, feedback, and suggestions about these patterns on the [ydn-patterns](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-patterns/) list. I'll be announcing new pattern releases here on the YUI Blog, and will continue the series of exploratory posts and essays Bill Scott started. Together I expect we will contribute to the public discussion of design pattern, interaction design, information architecture, and user experience in general.
