Yahoo! is heading to Seattle this February to host Open Tech Night at the University of Washington. We'll be showing off our new open platforms, spreading hack-fu with UW Hack U!, and featuring a very special keynote "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by our resident JavaScript guru, Douglas Crockford.

This is a great chance to hear about Yahoo!'s new APIs and new tools like YQL. Learn about building OpenSocial apps for Yahoo!'s vast audience and the social web while hanging out with Yahoo! engineers and thought leaders.
