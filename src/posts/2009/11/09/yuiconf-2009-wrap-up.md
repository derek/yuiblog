![Poster](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/yuiconf2009-summary/poster.png)Thank you to everyone who joined us for [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009/)! We hosted over 200 YUI developers, held 18 outstanding technical sessions, and featured three unforgettable keynotes over two short days. Some of our favorite highlights include:

-   Eric Miraglia unveiling [YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) to the world in [the opening keynote](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=miraglia-yuiconf2009-yui3).
-   Learning how far Events have come in YUI 3, in [Luke Smith's Events Evolved session](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=smith-yuiconf2009-events).
-   The [instant classic](http://twitter.com/izs/statuses/5249227498) that was [Brendan Eich's keynote](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=eich-yuiconf2009-harmony).
-   A giant teddy bear making a [cameo appearance](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nberry/4056949928/) in a couple of sessions Thursday afternoon.
-   Dav Glass' infectious enthusiasm in his [Contributing to YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=glass-yuiconf2009-contributing) session.
-   The really sweet tips dispensed in Todd Kloot's YUI Sugar session. (The video's coming — you don't want to miss this one, trust us.)
-   Douglas Crockford's hilarious and enlightening [closing keynote](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-yuiconf2009-state).
-   Hearing great talks from the developer community, including [Matt Snider of Mint.com (on the YUI Storage Utility)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=snider-yuiconf2009-storage) and [Eric Ferraiuolo of Oddnut (on building web apps with YUI 3)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=ericf-yuiconf2009-webapps).
-   Meeting hundreds of YUI developers from around the world. It was fantastic to meet in person for the first time so many developers we'd previously known only through email, IRC and forums.

And now for some big-time thank-yous to our sponsors:

-   [**Yahoo! Developer Network**](http://developer.yahoo.com/) who made the whole event a reality — particularly Chris Yeh and Havi Hoffman for their support and Stacy Milman for helping to bring off the event smoothly
-   **Yahoo! Academic Relations** (the folks who put on our university hack days) for sponsoring the Wednesday night show-and-tell
-   **O'Reilly** for providing each attendee with the [_Even Faster Web Sites_](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596522308/) ebook
-   and **Wiley**, **Packt**, and **Apress** for providing additional book givewaways

What a treat it was opening our doors to external developers for the first time this year. We loved hearing about all the cool projects everyone is working on and seeing folks sharing knowledge and sparking ideas off of one another. We hope everyone who came out had fun, learned something new, and continues to share with the YUI community

Same time next year?
