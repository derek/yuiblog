Come join [Anthony Pipkin](http://twitter.com/apipkin/) at the [Portfolio Center](http://www.meetup.com/atlantawebdesign/venue/1233778/?eventId=16324155&popup=true) with the [Atlanta Web Design Group](http://www.awdg.org/) on February 24th at 7:00 PM as he gives an introduction to YUI 3. His talk is an adaptation of the Introduction to YUI 3 course given by Yahoo's [Luke Smith](http://twitter.com/ls_n) at [YUIConf 2010](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2010/schedule.php#workshop) and [online](/yuiblog/2011/01/13/online-yui-3-introductory-course-monday-jan-17th/) last month. Anthony will be covering DOM manipulation and the event system that YUI 3 offers. The talk will end with ways to get YUI 3 into your project based on your needs. Check the AWDG web site for [event details and registration information](http://www.awdg.org/events/16324155/). Hope to see you there!
