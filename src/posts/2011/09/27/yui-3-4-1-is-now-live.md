![YUI 3.4.1](/yuiblog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/yui341.jpg "YUI 3.4.1")

The YUI 3.4.1 short cycle release is now available on [CDN](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.4.1/build/yui/yui-min.js) and for [download](http://yuilibrary.com/download/yui3/), more than a week early! Here are a few highlights for this release:

-   Over **150** [bug fixes](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/89) for [Controller](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/controller/), [Panel](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/panel/), [DataTable](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/datatable/), [Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/calendar/), and a number of other modules.
-   Bug fixes to [Y.substitute()](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/YUI~substitute.html#method_substitute) by YUI contributor [Satyam](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/user/satyam).
-   Japanese language support for [Calendar](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/calendar/) and [Console](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/console/), courtesy of YUI contributor [Ryuichi Okumura](https://github.com/okuryu).
-   Miscellaneous tweaks to the [documentation and examples.](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/)

You can can also review the [summary of all changes noted in the component history files for YUI 3.4.1](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/wiki/ReadMe/RollUp_3.4.1) as well as [the full list of tickets addressed during YUI 3.4.1 development](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/89). As always, we would appreciate that you file any suggestions you might have or defects you might uncover in our ticket database. Feedback for YUI 3.4.1 can be entered in [the YUI 3 ticket database](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/newticket?version=3.4.1).

We would also like to announce that in the next release of YUI, [DataType.Date, DataType.Number and DataType.XML](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/datatype/) will be deprecated in favor of Y.Date, Y.Number, and Y.XML, respectively. Backwards compatibility will be retained for one release, to give everyone a chance to switch over.

Oh, and one more thing: we are well on our way in migrating the [YUI Theater content to YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/yuilibrary). For starters, check out Douglas Crockford's lecture series ["Crockford on JavaScript"](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7664379246A246CB) -- complete with subtitles!
