[![Joe Hewitt announced the GA release of Firebug 1.0 at Yahoo yesterday.](/yuiblog/blog-archive/assets/hewitt-firebug1.jpg)](http://video.yahoo.com/watch/111597)

[Firebug 1.0](http://www.getfirebug.com/blog/2007/01/24/one-dot-oh/) hit the wires at Mozilla on Wednesday night and Firebug's author [Joe Hewitt](http://joehewitt.com/) of [Parakey Inc.](http://parakey.com/) stopped by Yahoo! Thursday to debut the new features. Joe was kind enough to let us record his talk, and we're pleased to share that with you in the [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/). Although I use Firebug on a daily basis, this was an eye-opening talk for me — I had no idea how much Firebug was capable of until I saw Joe give the power-user tour.

If you're reading this in a flash-capable viewer, you can check out [Joe's talk](http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=111597) in the embedded player below:

**Update 1/29:** Yahoo!'s Lauren Garcia has a nice [recap/summary of the talk](http://gougeyoureyesout.com/cssFun/2007/01/firebug-10-is-out-talk-for-power-users.html) on her blog.
