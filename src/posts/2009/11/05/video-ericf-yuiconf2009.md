[Eric Ferraiuolo](http://925html.com/) ([@ericf](http://twitter.com/ericf)) of Boston-area startup Oddnut Software made the trip to [YUICONF 2009](http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf2009) last week to give a talk on the deployment of YUI 3-based applications in the real world. The talk presents a lot of wisdom Eric and his team have acquired since beginning to build on YUI 3 about a year ago, and it was one of the best-received talks at the conference.
